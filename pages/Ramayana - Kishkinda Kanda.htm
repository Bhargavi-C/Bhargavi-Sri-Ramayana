<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b><i>Prelude:</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Rama meets Sugriva and forges a friendship true</i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>He kills Vali and gets Sugriva his kingdom and wife: his due</i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Sugriva assembles his army and a search for Sita he launches</i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Rama hands over his ring to Hanuman, who fear and misery staunches<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Monkeys sent in all directions except the south, return empty-handed</i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Hanuman's group reach the southern ocean shore, and learn at Lanka Sita is stranded.</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b> </b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>The story in detail:</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b> </b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">As Rama and Lakshmana neared the Rishyamukha mountain</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The vigilant Sugriva watched them with a mounting tension</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Swiftly calling his minister Hanuman’s attention</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva said: “I alternate between hope and consternation.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Perceive the two warriors that eagerly approach</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Their erect and noble aspect is beyond reproach.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“I charge you to go forward and find</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Whether they are friend or foe: what kind</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">In case they are emissaries of Vali, my brother cruel</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You may count me among the dead without even a duel</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If they are men with intent neutral</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I can befriend them and to my advantage use their arrival.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman, that loyal monkey, fully endowed</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Prepared to spy: into their midst, can the new entrants be allowed?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“I shall transform into a ‘<i>Brahmin</i>’ and accost the two</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I will gather their purpose and soon make my report to you,”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Said he with earnest zeal and made for the way</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Along which Rama-Lakshmana walked, making rapid headway.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman was the son of ‘Anjana’ and ‘Vayu’, the wind god</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Christened Maruti, his charm and strength, everyone did laud</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">One day a ravenous baby ‘Anjaneya’ went for the sun</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Thinking it to be a delicious fruit that must be won.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The frightened sun god ran to Indra and sought refuge</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The enraged King of gods struck the baby like a deluge</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hit near the mouth by Indra’s thunderbolt, Maruti fell to earth</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Unconscious and with a swollen jaw, lay that baby of infinite worth</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Vayu, angered, held his breath and refused to let go</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">All created beings began to choke as a result of this row</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The anxious Indra and Lord Brahma hastened forward</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To mollify Vayu and set right the worlds' suffering, untoward</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Lord Brahma said, “O Vayu, please fulfil your function</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Do not torment the world; have some compunction.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The wrathful Vayu asked, “Indra has attacked</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My son, a mere child: is his act being backed?”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Brahma pacifically replied, “Indra is here to make Maruti well</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He agrees, his indignation, he should have worked to quell.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">At this, Indra apologized profusely and begged Vayu for pardon:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> “Maruti reached for the sun thinking it to be a fruit from a garden</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">On beholding his act, I was gripped by a thoughtless panic<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And not considering his playful ignorance, I gave in to a fury volcanic</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Maruti will acquire fame as ‘Hanuman’ the one with a broken jaw</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Look at him rise now; with his intelligence, everyone he shall draw.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Pacified, Vayu let out the wind force he had been holding</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He hugged Hanuman to his chest with his love unfolding</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Every god in heaven came forth and bestowed boons</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">On Hanuman, the wonder child, with the strength of typhoons</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Lord Brahma gave Maruti a blessing most valuable:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“You shall recognise the ‘<i>Paramatma</i>’: my boon is infallible.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Everyone present was overjoyed for Maruti, that prodigious little child<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Who asked, “How do I understand I’ve seen the supreme?” with a smile mild<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Brahma explained, “Realise you are in the Supreme’s presence</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When your bones melt and love infinite fills your every sense.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman thanked all the gods congregated in the assembly</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">A celibate and forever Rama’s ardent devotee, he was born to be.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">That remarkable Hanuman now appeared before Sri Rama and looked</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He felt his bones thawing and his every sense becoming hooked</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He knew he was seeing the Lord of Lords Himself in person</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And realised his life had been sanctified beyond comparison</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The tears began to flow down the face of that master of self-control:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Is it possible for a devotee to keep his senses under strict patrol?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman, in the presence of Rama, the Pure Soul</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Failed to conceal his identity, though that was his goal</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Upon Hanuman, Rama's cool and all-bestowing gaze fell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The monkey's sins fled and nothing but truth could he spell!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Who are you two, who resemble beings from heaven?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Though dressed like gentle hermits, you look far from craven."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"You have a bold stance, rounded shoulders, and broad chest</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Warriors you must be: that, your features do suggest</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Why have you left your well-shaped bodies bare?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To don jewels that offer cover from evil glances, you should’ve taken care.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I am Hanuman, son of Vayu and minister of Sugriva, the exiled monkey King</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Details about the two of you, he directed me to bring."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama listened to Hanuman's speech with a growing admiration</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Tell him about us, dear Lakshmana," He said with determination<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Had the monkey chief spoken to me, I would have replied</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Since his minister has spoken, through you, my response must be supplied</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I have delegated to you the position of my dear, departed father</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">In this far-away forest, I charge you to also act as my envoy and minister."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Let me warn you to be careful, before you begin to speak:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Your chances of exceeding Hanuman's articulation are but weak</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Not only were his words, tone and diction faultless</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Even his body language and facial expressions were fabulous.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">His mouth opened and shut just like graceful lotus petals</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">His speech, clear and concise, is worthy of earning medals."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"With such an assistant by his side, no king needs to worry</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Easily accomplishing formidable feats, he can make merry</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This son of Vayu has exhibited the nuances of political wisdom</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">His support would mean security and growth to any kingdom</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Evidently, Hanuman is a monkey most remarkably learned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He must know the nine grammars of <i>'Sanskrit'</i> and the  <i>'Veda-Vedanta'</i>, sacred."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Coming from the '<i>Vaagme Sriman</i>' Rama, this was indeed high praise</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">For, Rama's eloquence had won accolades from Vasishta, hard to entice.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Lakshmana, the avatar of Adisesha, the thousand-hooded serpent</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Had a thousand tongues to speak with, to everyone's content</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">That Rama should caution this capable speaker</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Is proof of Hanuman's infinite intelligence and sagacity proper</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama further said: "From learning the <i>Rig Veda</i>, Hanuman has acquired real humility</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><i>Yajur</i> and <i>Sama Veda</i> have given him retentive powers and scholarly temerity.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I feel a new confidence on account of this providential meeting</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I also wish to acquaint with Sugriva and offer him my greeting.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Once again Lakshmana, think through what you want to say, well</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Speak to Hanuman and all his doubts, please dispel."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now, Lakshmana began to narrate their story in brief:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"We are sons of Dasaratha, Kosala's emperor and an Ikshvaku chief</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To keep his word, he sent his eldest son Rama on a fourteen-year exile</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I, Rama's brother, nay slave, and Sita, His wife, followed upon His trail</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">After spending thirteen years, meeting scores of ascetics in peace</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We were visited by a misfortune: Sita, the demon Ravana did seize."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"This here is Rama: together we have come with the sole desire</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To seek and rescue Sita, for which a friend we require."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Listening intently to Lakshmana's narrative,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman came to a conclusion definitive</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Permit me to take you to Sugriva, shunned by Vali, his brother</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You would benefit mutually: of this, I am absolutely sure."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman led Rama and Lakshmana to Sugriva's cave</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And a sacred and influential friendship he went on to pave</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Said Hanuman: "O Sugriva, behold Rama, who resembles a fearless lion</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">O Rama, here is powerful Sugriva, the sun god's scion</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Please extend and clasp your hands in friendship<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Pledge to destroy your unjust enemies with this strong partnership."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva and Rama did as Hanuman suggested</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And burning a fire as their holy witness, the two united</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sitting side by side, tied in friendship's true and strong bond</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama and Sugriva gazed at each other for long, with smiles fond</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Just then the left eyes of Vali and Ravana quivered, portending their defeat</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And the left eye of Sita too throbbed, foretelling an auspicious treat.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Presently, Sugriva brought forth a piece of cloth tied into a bundle</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And asked: "Do this cloth and the jewels inside, any memories, kindle?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Many days back we saw a lady being taken along the aerial route</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Amidst us, jewels wrapped in her upper cloth, she did shoot</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Do they belong to your dear wife Sita—please verify</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">By helping you win Her back, I shall our friendship, fructify."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama, upon recognising Sita's garment, became tearful</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Riotous emotions gripped Him and made His aspect fearful</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Asking Lakshmana to identify the bundle, Rama brooded<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva opened the cloth that with Sita's jewels was loaded</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He pulled out the ornaments one by one and exhibited each</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Lakshmana said, "O Sugriva, show me the anklets alone, I beseech."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"I have never gazed on my sister-in-law, out of modesty and deference,</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I have seen Her anklets though, when bowing at her feet daily as a mark of reverence<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I can confirm this pair belongs to that gentle lady of peerless character<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Please narrate to us what transpired and describe the cruel abductor."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">In reply, Sugriva said, "We saw a goddess-like lady being borne away</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">She looked terrified, with her face bathed in tears and her hair in disarray."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">However, when she perceived us, this package she did fling</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">With folded hands, solace, she prayed the heavens to bring."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hearing this, the equanimous Rama was moved to a terrible rage</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva, in a soft voice, consoled Him and advised courage</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"After You eliminate Vali, I shall command our monkey army, vast</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We will find Sita: I will not let your grief last."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Pacified by the soothing counsel, Rama soon became composed</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He asked Sugriva, "Describe well why Vali towards you is ill-disposed."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva answered: "Vali, my elder, ruled over Kishkinda wisely</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">His power is so great that none would fight him wantonly</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But one day, a demon named Dundubi challenged him to a combat</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And Vali rushed into battle, desiring to crush him like a rat.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">For many days, the two continued to fight</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, there came a day when Dundubi could not meet Vali's might</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The demon took to his heels and hid in a cave</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Vali followed and said to me: "I shall make this place his grave.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You guard the mouth of this cave until I return</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I do not want Dundubi to escape and from the fight adjourn."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Thus instructing me, Vali went after Dundubi with a fearsome roar</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">A year went by, but I continued waiting near the door</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Soon after, though, I heard frantic and desperate cries</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Following this, blood gushed out: I couldn't believe my eyes</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"O my poor brother is dead," I thought and was by grief blinded</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"I must shut the cave—here, the demon must be grounded."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rolling a huge boulder to the cave's mouth, I carefully sealed it</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And running back to our kingdom, I lamented: "Mighty Vali is hit.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My brother lives no more, we are without a guide</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Is there anyone to replace Vali, our tribe's pride?"</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Soon all the monkey elders came together and decided</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"You ascend the throne and safeguard it": thus was I goaded.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Vali, however, had not died and soon he made an appearance</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When he saw I had been crowned King, he  lost all his coherence</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"You tried shutting me up in the cave, you coward!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, I have obliterated your plan, vile and soured.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now, I shall kill you with my hands bare</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">For your dastardly act, your life I shall not spare."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Thus swore Vali and I trembled in despair and trepidation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Trying to pacify him, I ventured into a rapid explanation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Vali, not inclined to believe me, came at me with raised arms</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I, while fleeing him, continued to placate him with folded palms</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, that cruel brother of mine ignored all my pleas and submission</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To crush me into oblivion seemed his one and only mission.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"I took refuge in this mountain, where Vali dares not enter</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He has been cursed: if he sets foot here, his head shall shatter</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I have resided here since then, with barely a semblance of dignity</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Vali took over my wife as his own, showing further his malignity</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman and a few more monkeys who to me are faithful</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Live with me and of Vali's whereabouts we ever remain watchful."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">All this Sugriva said in a subdued and trembling tone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama knew, Vali's excesses, He could not condone</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He said, "You and I have been separated forcibly from our wives</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To annihilate the criminals, you watch how your friend Rama strives</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You go to Vali's gates and challenge him to a duel</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">With my sharp arrow, I shall pierce his heart cruel."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva, though pleased, said: "I can describe Vali's brawn by the hour.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Vali's back and <i>Vishnu</i>'s ‘<i>Kurma avatar</i>’, have the same power</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The nails on Vali's fingers match the strength of ‘<i>Narasimha</i>'s nails</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">At the vigour of Vali's teeth that match ‘<i>Varaha</i>'s teeth, the entire world quails</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My brother Vali has vitality that equals a multitude of gods</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">People who try to underrate his brute force are certainly retards."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">While Sugriva praised his brother, Rama did not interrupt:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He wanted to eradicate his friend's doubts without being abrupt</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">With calm assurance He said: "Using my unparalleled bow,</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I shoot the most potent arrows that suppress any foe.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">So, go forth and call out to Vali, that unreasonable sinner</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I shall kill him and you can reclaim your wife, as a winner."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Even after Rama's assertion, Sugriva remained unconvinced<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman, who knew Rama for the Supreme, inwardly winced<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He took Sugriva aside and counselled, "You could conduct a test.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Then, Rama's capability, you could for yourself attest.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I recognise Rama as the Lord of all creation</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">His mere will can nullify Vali: know Rama as <i>Narayana</i>'s incarnation."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">So, Sugriva went up to Rama and spoke thoughtfully</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Do you perceive those massive sal trees grown fully?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Vali can shoot each one down with a single stroke!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Can you do that my friend: excuse my doubts, if they provoke!"</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama got up and straightening His bow shot an arrow</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Instantly, it pierced seven sal trees and returned to His quiver, in one go.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva, though elated, had one more test on his mind</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He said, "Yonder lies Dundubi's skeleton, a colossus of his kind</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This carcass Vali had thrown many miles, after killing the fiend</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Will You show us what You can do? With that my doubts would end!"</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama, with His ever-present smile, turned to Lakshmana and gestured</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">That exemplar kicked the skeleton and it flew into oblivion, unfettered.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva, his reservations vanquished, squared his shoulders<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And strode forth to challenge Vali, capable of smashing boulders</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He went to the gates of Kishkinda and roared, "Vali, you coward</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I challenge you to a duel: if you dare, you must come forward."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva then smacked his shoulders and thighs in readiness<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">While Vali, though rudely shaken, became eager to show his rowdiness.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Tara, Vali’s discerning wife, stopped him and warned:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“Sugriva has joined forces with Rama, who is not to be scorned.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When all these days, he has been cowering at your very name</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You must think wherefrom he gets this courage without blame.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama is not an ordinary mortal—I have heard of his deeds<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He is both valorous and sublime and He always succeeds.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Vali heard his wife’s counsel but refused to sit tight</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“I do agree with what you say, but cannot ignore a challenge to my might</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I would rather die a heroic death than remain craven</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Have faith in your Vali’s strength and for my victory, pray to heaven.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Saying this, Vali hurried out of his palace with his mace</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And Tara looked on, troubled over what was to take place.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">While Sugriva and Vali assembled to duel unto death</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama hid behind a tree, ready to strike an arrow into Vali’s formidable girth</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, when he saw the two great apes fighting one another</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Their close physical resemblance perplexed Him altogether</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Reluctant to let go of His arrow, Rama stood mesmerised</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">While by Vali poor Sugriva was getting pulverised</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Soon, unable to keep up with Vali’s pugnacious instinct</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva's fear and regret over entering the duel became distinct</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Deciding to quit the fight, Sugriva fled at top speed:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The derisive Vali's taunts hurt him like a poisonous weed</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Coming over to Rama, he cried, "Oh, why for me this humiliation?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">While your friend was being badgered, why did you pause in hesitation?"</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama hurriedly explained: "I failed to distinguish you from your brother</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I refrained from shooting, thinking a wrong target I might smother</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Here, wear this garland of leaves so that I may recognise you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now, go and challenge Vali once more, so I can give him his due."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva placed implicit trust in Rama and obeyed his words</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He went out to Vali and for a duel, roared again from his innards.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Vali, astonished beyond belief, returned in a rush to fight</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And shouted, "You have asked for death as your plight."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This time, Rama made no delay in releasing His arrow, sure</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">It found Vali's heart and pierced it, wounding him without cure</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Lying prostrate on the ground, Vali looked around for his attacker</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Only a powerful divinity could slay him in this way, instanter.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Vali now perceived Rama emerging from behind a clump of trees</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And felt His pleasing form caress him like a soothing breeze</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva sprang down at Vali's feet and out of guilt sobbed</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"My own brother, I have killed," cried he, while his heart in sorrow throbbed</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama walked up and placed His hand on Sugriva's shoulder, pacifically<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And He too began to lament over His friend's loss, brokenly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Excruciatingly, Vali pulled out the fatal arrow from his chest</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He recognised it as coming from Rama's quiver by its crest</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Shocked, he asked Rama, "Oh Rama, You stand there like a lovely painting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Your handsome countenance and soft eyes are so misleading</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You are like a dry well whose mouth is covered with leaves:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Anyone who walks over it, it sucks in and cleaves."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">How could you hit me, concealed behind a tree?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Being Dasaratha's son, I never could dream this of thee</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Wait: even that King sent You into exile as per a woman's whim</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, being Bharatha's brother, how could you in malpractice swim?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Separated from Your virtuous wife, who came out of the milky ocean</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You know not what You do; You have lost Your compassion."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Vali's words, though uttered in anger and disappointment, held a great truth</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita's proximity and distance determined Rama's pity and ruth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When She is near Him, He condones and never kills</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, when Sita is away, Rama punishes using His warring skills</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita is tolerance-and-forgiveness personified<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To practise these qualities, She constantly keeps Rama notified.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Vali continued: "Did Your ancestor Manu, who laid down Dharmic rules, state:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">'To recover his kidnapped wife, a monkey, one must kill and cremate?'</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Then, the sarcastic Vali proceeded to ask of Rama six questions straight</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He meant to understand Rama's justification for contradicting His renowned trait</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"You and I do not have troubles over our kingdoms' borders</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We know not each other nor are we enemies to pass killing orders."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"While I am part of the animal species, You are a human, noble</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Assuming You had reason to kill me, concealing Yourself was surely ignoble?"</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If You came to hunt me: did You crave my skin, hair, nails, or meat?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If You punished me: did I, a Brahmin, woman or a King, murder or beat?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Answer me these questions with truth and sincerity</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If you fail to convince me, You shall lose Your fame for eternity."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama listened to Vali's words with His usual smile, divine and calm</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Standing—bent at the knee, waist and neck—He cast forth a divine charm.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama then began to answer Vali's questions with quiet confidence:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">After all, of valour, mercy and justice, He was the supreme confluence<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Vali, despite being in death's throes, listened with rapt attention</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And felt mollified by Rama's soothing tones that held silent conviction<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama said: “Bharatha rules from Ayodhya; I’m here as his servant:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">That I ensure peace in the jungle regions is Bharatha’s desire fervent</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This entire earth belongs to the Ikshvaku dynasty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">That Kishkinda is under you is your impression hasty</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hence I do take issue with you on the sharing of land<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">As an answer to your first question, this to you, I hand.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“There is no need to know each other for discord to rise</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And this answers your second question too, without compromise</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I remained unseen: while hunting an animal, it is the norm</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I came to hunt you, because to fair behaviour you did not conform</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">By taking your brother's wife forcibly for your own<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Into the chasm of despicable misconduct did you drown.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Understand that I hunted you down as punishment:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Thus have I answered your doubts with no need for concealment.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Upon hearing Rama's exposition, Vali felt vastly satisfied:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Your justice is clear and not disputable," he sighed</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“O Rama, how big Your heart is to answer an inferior and sinner!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">By Your gracious glance alone, I shall reach Your permanent realm, a winner."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“After You rescue Sita and return to Ayodhya to assume sovereignty</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Your brothers will ask You to describe Your experiences, in all probability</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When You tell them, “Sugriva got me to kill Vali, his sibling”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">They may mock my brother’s hostility without thinking</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Please stop them and say: “Sugriva accepted Kishkinda, a place insignificant</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And gave Vali a berth at Sri Vaikunta, that abode supreme and permanent.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“Protect Sugriva as Your friend forever and also Angada, my young son</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Always at Your side, keep Hanuman, the monkey who cannot be undone.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Saying this, Vali gave up his life and reached the highest empire</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Tara, his wife, came running and fell over his body, as if about to expire</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">She began lamenting loudly and cried: “O Vali, you said I am your life</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Then, how come you have perished leaving me your adoring wife?”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“I thought you always spoke the truth: but you seem to have lied</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Had I been your life, like you said, I too must have died!”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now, Tara turned to Rama in anger, meaning to reprimand Him</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Instead, she heaped praise, though her eyes with tears did brim</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“O Rama, You are beyond my comprehension</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> I cannot make You out, though you stand before me, in person.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“Forget me, a mere monkey! You, the best scriptures cannot pretend to understand<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Not just that, even You cannot fathom Your own self: Your qualities are so grand.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You are not limited by time, space or form</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You transcend everything and are beyond all material norm</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You came here ostentatiously to fulfill Your father’s word to Your step-mother</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Your actions indicate You are the Supreme Person: the exile is just a cover</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Kabandha and Viradha, why did You kill?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">That was not what Your father wanted You to fulfil!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You sent Jatayu and Shabari to '<i>Moksha</i>' and terminated myriad demons</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And now, You have killed Vali and sent him to the best of regions."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">One might think the Lord is far away and hence is incomprehensible<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But Tara proved, even when He is in front of one, He is not understandable.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Why did Tara address Rama as "You" which was disrespectful?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To her, none could equal Vali, whom she thought was all-powerful<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">In addition, an impolite reference equalled the death punishment<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The angry Tara wanted to fling on Rama that embarrassment<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">However, on perceiving Him, her doubts vanished<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And she celebrated Rama, her fury totally vanquished<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"You are not readily apparent: you stay hidden in scriptures</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When You reveal Yourself to the wise, they go into raptures.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">That You have won over Your senses is evident:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I stand here talking, while with Your eyes averted, You stand diffident<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My beauty is so great—everyone gives me a second look</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, I can see that You are dedicated to the single wife You took."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You befriended Sugriva and helped him regain his princely status</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And the Kingdom You won, You directly gave him, without a fuss."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You are a '<i>Uttama Purusha</i>'—you are in the category of 'superior persons'</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Who undergo miseries to do good to others without rhyme or reasons</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Even when You do everything for everyone impartially<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You feel You should have done more and are not satisfied fully."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Your glory is too immense for anyone to reduce</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Your qualities are infinite: pure thoughts alone they induce.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Furthermore, here have I been, ranting heatedly for a long while</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Yet, You stand with Mother Earth's patience, listening with a smile<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Also, You are clever and show presence of mind</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You gave Sugriva a garland to ensure he was easy to find."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You answered Vali's questions and mitigated his doubt</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">His sins and soiled thoughts You were the One to rout</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I came here with the express view of denouncing you</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, without saying a word, you have me paying tributes, more than a few!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You have eyes that show radiant red lines all over</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">With Your loving gaze, mercy and grace, You shower."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">After acclaiming Rama, Tara wept for Vali, tears copious</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Vali's cremation was soon conducted in a manner glorious<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Both Tara and Sugriva, were driven by grief acute</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">They decided to shed their lives, feeling destitute<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, Rama and Hanuman pacified the two<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And reminded them: "You have earthly duties to do."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama instructed Lakshmana thus: "Sugriva's coronation you must conduct</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The next few are monsoon months, when the monkeys can recoup and resurrect<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">After the rains, let Sugriva send his armies in all directions, as promised</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The monkeys shall look for Janaki everywhere: no avenue shall be missed."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Lakshmana went into the Kishkinda kingdom and pronounced Sugriva King</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And came back to wait on Rama and to Him, solace, he endeavoured to bring.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama and Lakshmana went to Mount Prasavana during the rains</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And stayed in a cave, Malyavaan, by name, listening to nature's wet strains</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Just like the Supreme stays inactive after creation's total dissolution<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama too lived in that cave like a lion, subdued, before intense action</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And similar to the Lord who creates all the worlds afresh when the time is ripe</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama awaited the cessation of rainfall, when Ravana He would wipe</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"The sun's rays impregnate the oceans and clouds are made</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">After nine months, the heavens deliver them as rain and with it the rivers parade</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">O Lakshmana, rain is the elixir of life, the nectar that nourishes</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If the monsoons fail, due to lack of water, every life form perishes</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This scene reminds me of Sita, who, heated by agony, must be shedding tears</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My very soul, this rainwater gushing over the heated earth, sears."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Lamenting thus, Rama drooped and fell away senseless</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Lakshmana gently lifting Him said, "Giving in to despair is useless.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Is it nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Is it wise to lament and wail over events, inopportune?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Or as brave Kshatriyas, should we take arms against our sea of troubles<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And end them? —We must punish the sinners till every eye in their army bubbles.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Let not Your resolution be sicklied over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">With hopelessness: it does not become Your valour.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Using Sugriva's support, that hapless and gentle Sita, we will locate</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And through battle, we will make the offenders supplicate."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">In this manner, Lakshmana kept Rama's hopes afloat</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Once again, Lakshmana's service, Rama gratefully did note.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva, during that period, wallowed in sensuous pleasure</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">His role as Rama's friend, he forgot, busy revelling in full measure<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, Hanuman his ever-dutiful and clever minister remained aware</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And when the rainy season's end neared, he warned Sugriva to beware</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"When you were floundering in distress, Rama came to your aid</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now it's time for your word to be honoured and His help repaid."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Rama is not to be trifled with: His anger is like a forest fire</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">It burns and annihilates everything without discrimination or fear."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">At Hanuman's counsel, Sugriva temporarily regained control of his sense</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He ordered: "Within fifteen days, all monkeys must register here their presence."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">After putting his commanders in charge of this mission,</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva once again plunged into revelry without intermission.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When three months elapsed, the climate became conducive for energetic enterprises</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama eagerly awaited word from Sugriva, unaware of his tryst with vices</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When no message came, Rama's ire was stirred</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He said to Lakshmana: "My wrath, Sugriva has incurred."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Lakshmana, nay, Adisesha the hot-tempered serpent queried:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Shall I kill that betrayer of trust, Sugriva, and have him buried?"</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama, the ever-pacific said: "Friendship have I declared.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I mustn’t break it precipitously: Sugriva's shortcoming must be spared.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I shall give him a chance: you go to him with a warning</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And tell him: 'Rama has not closed the route Vali took after dying.'</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This should instil in Sugriva a sense of his duty</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He will strive to discover Sita, my divine beauty."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Lakshmana strode out towards Kishkinda’s gate</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">At his angry step, monkeys along the way began to prostrate</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Standing at the kingdom’s entrance, Lakshmana twanged his bow</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Its reverberations shook the earth and sky and white fear did it sow</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva began trembling in sheer terror and looked around with consternation wild</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman swiftly said: “To meet Lakshmana, we must send a female monkey, mild.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“Tara is a clever debater and is best suited to accost Lakshmana first</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Her sight and speech would calm that unflinching warrior, I fully trust.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Thus, it was Tara who boldly went out to meet Lakshmana’s anger:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">She knew his fighting code didn’t permit him to put women in danger.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When Lakshmana saw who was approaching, he was disconcerted</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Tara’s presence abashed him and he bowed his head, flustered.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Tara slowly began to speak and made an attempt to find out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Why Lakshmana was here, in a mood for a big bout</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Lakshmana admonished: “How can Sugriva indulge in ‘Kama’, nay, pleasure-seeking?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He has forgotten his promise to Rama and lies in a stupor without waking!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Tara replied: “I agree ‘<i>Kama</i>’ is wrong. But, what about ‘<i>Krodha</i>’ or anger?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You are displaying that in ample measure now, making us all cower!”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“Have you forgotten your teacher Vishwamitra’s weaknesses?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He gave in to ‘<i>Kama</i>’ and ‘<i>Krodha</i>’: for that, there are witnesses!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He lost the fruits of his ‘<i>sandhyavandana</i>’, a <i>brahmin</i>’s three-time worship</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He begot a daughter through the divine damsel Menaka’s companionship.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This retort held Lakshmana and he hurriedly smoothened his frown</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And asked to meet Sugriva, after swiftly calming down.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman and Sugriva presently strode forth full of purpose</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And relieved Lakshmana’s suspicions, though still a little nervous</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva offered to Lakshmana fruits and roots, choice</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Lakshmana declined decidedly, in a clear voice</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"I eat only what has first been proffered to Rama," he said</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Anything else I consider as leftover from what a dog is fed."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Lakshmana established that a meal presented to the Lord becomes sanctified:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To partake of such food is desirable, as its ill effects get nullified.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Acceding, Sugriva informed: “I have already sent word to all our monkey tribe</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We expect them momentarily: their immense powers we cannot sufficiently describe.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Let us go over to Rama and inform Him about the developments in the meanwhile</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He can command the army, as though it were his own, in His inimitable style.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva called the male monkeys and asked them to enter into a treaty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Let us commit to Rama's service, and reciprocate His kindness per propriety"</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The monkeys enthusiastically bid farewell to their families<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And joined the throng to seek Sita whose probity transcended similes  <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now, all the valorous monkeys with Sugriva at their head</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Reached Rama's presence and waited patiently to be led.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva stood still and quiet before Rama with folded palms</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And put his head upon Rama's feet with his heart full of qualms<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama gently lifted Sugriva and held him in a tight embrace</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Probity, prosperity and pleasure, in that order, a king must chase:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Remember, ‘<i>Dharma, Artha and Kama’</i> are virtues the wise have stated."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama advised kindly and asked Sugriva to be seated.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Looking at the rapidly surging monkey army, Rama said, feeling satisfied,</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Discuss the impending endeavour with your ministers who stand unified."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva announced: "Rama's gentle wife Sita the cruel Ravana abducted</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The place where she is kept concealed, in haste, must be detected.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I plan to send you all in groups in eight different directions</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Look for her in every spot and report back within a month—these are my injunctions."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">After speaking thus, Sugriva divided his army into eight portions<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And assigning a leader to every one of them, began dispersing instructions<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He described the roads, wilderness, mountains and rivers</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">As well as caves, lanes, towns, cities, lakes, and other landmarks, diverse</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama, who was watching the proceedings, was astounded<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">At Sugriva's intimate knowledge of locations and his memory unbounded<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Dear Sugriva, how intricately you know this earth!" Rama exclaimed</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Tell me how you acquired this familiarity that deserves to be acclaimed."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva replied: "When Vali chased me, I ran hither and thither</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Looking for a sanctuary, my heart in a perpetual flutter.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Running up mountains, hiding in caves, going underground,</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Concealing myself in forests—I just went round and round."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"I was forced to remember these locales—for me it was a 'life or death' feat</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Until I hid in the Rishyamukha Mountains and found protection at Your lotus feet."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama listened carefully and hugging Sugriva said: "Great is your intelligence!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If you observe so much, when running for your life, how much more you'd with diligence?"</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now, Sugriva proceeded to handpick monkeys for the southern direction:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">About Sita being taken that way, he did have first-hand information<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva chose Angada to lead the monkeys going Southward</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He also asked Hanuman and Jambhavan, the bear, to come forward</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva, turning to Rama, queried: "Do You wish to give any further counsel?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This group, most likely to spot Sita, is waiting to hear Your proposal."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama called to Hanuman, after sitting in quiet thought for a while</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He removed His finger ring and handed it to him with a smile.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Take this as identification. It holds for Sita and me, memories, most cherished<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">That you meet Her in person is a consummation devoutly to be wished."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman was overwhelmed and humbled at the same moment</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The instant Rama's ring touched his hands he recognised his determination, dormant.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Clearly, anyone who received the Supreme's ring would have acquired</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Powers enough to see Sita and ascertain Her welfare, as required.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When such is the case, why did Rama choose Hanuman for this mission?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman, being an austere bachelor, failed to understand Rama's passion.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He thought: "Being the embodiment of every kind of power</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Why must Rama, so much extremity for love, suffer?"</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Having read his mind, Raghava decided: "Hanuman is most suited</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To see Sita and understand Her loftiness: this much he has merited."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva warned his monkey army: "Don't step on Venkataadri, the lush mountains</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If you do, your sins will be burnt and you will escape this material existence:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To me, it's now important you find Sita; your 'moksha' must wait</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">For us, embarking on a sacred mission, the 'Seven Hills' are but bait.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And remember: report back within thirty days and impart your news.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Into Sugriva’s gallant monkeys, his words enthusiasm did infuse.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama, with hope surging in His heart, thought of Sita's plight</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Let our messengers find you well; may your life not have taken flight!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">May your mind remain strong and sane thy brain<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">May your heart fill with hope; may no misfortune come between us twain."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Tears welled and rolled down Rama's chiselled and pale cheeks:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, He perceived astrological signs that showed His felicity would soon touch peaks.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Within the month, the monkey chiefs from all directions except the South returned</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Though they had searched diligently, about Sita, no clues they had learned</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now, all their hopes lay pinned on Hanuman and his band<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The delay and anxiety, Rama and His friends, could hardly withstand</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">However, Sita’s abduction towards the South and Hanuman’s competence</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Proved to be factors that gave them all much-needed confidence</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">In the meanwhile, the monkeys moving in the southerly direction</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Failed to find success and began to give way to vexation</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">After combing the Vindhya mountains and its secret hideouts</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And after searching even uninhabited spots, the monkeys entertained doubts</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“Is Mother Sita even alive? Has Ravana devoured Her?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We cannot return to give negative news: on this we concur.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Soon, Angada fought and killed a demon who appeared on their way:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Upon realising it was not Ravana, the monkeys’ moods once again turned grey</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, Angada motivated them by his sage advice:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“We cannot whine: are we monkeys or mice?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You are right: we cannot face Sugriva without success</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">His indignation will not spare even one of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“However, we do have a little time left and let us not sit still</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This much of spirit in us, our elders did instil.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We are enervated by lack of food, water and sleep</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, on Rama’s mission, we cannot act like meek sheep.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">At this, the monkeys grew jubilant and hopeful<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And with refreshed minds, overcame their attitudes slothful.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Presently, they found a dark cavity on their patrol</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And were intrigued by the secretive and stealthy black hole</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Deciding excitedly that this could be Sita’s prison</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">They ventured into its murky interior to sate their suspicion</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Suddenly, they saw a palace beautifully lit and luxurious</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The delicious food and drink there made the monkeys delirious</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">While the astonished monkeys hesitated about what to do</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">A saintly woman walked smilingly into their view</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“This is a palace built by a demon; it lies in my care now</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If your purpose is pure, you shall go free: this I do vow.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">At this the monkeys explained their mission in detail</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And the woman ‘Swayamprabha’ listened raptly to their tale.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When she gripped their story, she welcomed Sitarama’s envoys</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And plied them with abundant food and drink of choice</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Then she transported them using ascetic powers to the Southern-most mountain</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And said: "Yonder vast expanse of waters is the southerly ocean.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Bidding them a benignant farewell, that lady went to her lair</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Leaving the monkeys baffled about how to find Sita, the lady fair.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">On encountering the inexorable ocean, Angada started to panic</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“Our time limit has elapsed and about our future prospect, I am frantic.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Presenting ourselves in front of Sugriva without Sita’s bearings is suicide<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Instead, I propose we all fast unto death here: I call upon you to decide.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Most of those virtuous simians agreed with Angada’s views:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“Let us not return only to disappoint Rama: closed are all our avenues.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But Hanuman criticized Angada for his hasty suggestion</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And reminded him about the blame that comes with sedition</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He added further: “You are not only intelligent, but also spirited</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You know many tactics and with great traits and glory you are credited</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Then why speak in this manner of a loser?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Recollect you are the son of Vali admired for his indefatigable valour”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Though Hanuman’s words gave the monkeys pause,</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">They were afraid to face Sugriva and his fearsome laws</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The monkeys now began to sit down one by one</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">While discussing how by their misfortune they were undone</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Angada lamented: “Let us follow in the footsteps of Jatayu, that mighty bird</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Just like him, let us give up our lives: this decision is not absurd.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“Jatayu fought Ravana and died in battle for Rama’s sake</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We too wandered thus far risking our lives without break</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now, having transgressed Sugriva’s deadline and struck a dead-end<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To our pitiable fate, we must our heads bend.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sampati, an elderly vulture, who waited nearby expecting a sumptuous meal</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Heard Angada’s words and a searing sorrow he began to feel.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hopping over to the monkeys’ side the poor vulture inquired:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“Is my dearest younger brother Jatayu slain? Has he really expired?”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When the monkeys confirmed Jatayu’s murder, Sampati grieved hard</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“I saved young Jatayu from the sun: but, my burnt wings, I had to discard.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Alas, what use is that? Before I could, my younger brother has passed on</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I let Ravana go without a fight and now I stand woe begone.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"After I lost my wings, I fell on this mountainous region</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I decided to give up my life as I had also lost my kingdom and my legion</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, a kind sage named Nishaakara gave me a pair of small wings and courage</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And said: "To regain your wings, monkeys you must encourage.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">They will come here in the service of Rama looking for Sita, His wife</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You must give them Sita's news and then you shall regain your splendid life."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Many months ago, I saw Ravana fly over the ocean with a radiant lady</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Kidnapping women and persecuting virtuous folk is Ravana’s malady</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I may be a helpless creature without my mighty wing</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, I would have challenged Ravana, had I known about Jatayu’s killing.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Let me help you all and also Rama by imparting information:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">With Sita, I saw Ravana landing at Lanka, his opulent nation.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">All the monkeys felt at these words a surge of relief</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">That this news was a beacon of hope was their firm belief</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Soon they saw Sampati's wings grow in dimension<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And were amazed and grateful for this serendipitous intervention<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now, they all felt optimistic and with very good reason:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">They just had to think of a way to get across the ocean.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Angada, Hanuman, and Jambhavan, the elderly bear, were able leaders:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The monkeys had no doubts they would be given the right orders</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sampati had said the distance to Lanka was a hundred '<i>yojana</i>' over water</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now, Angada became keen to find a monkey who could be Sita's spotter</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He himself was capable of jumping a hundred '<i>yojana</i>' length</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, to search for Janaki and carry back Her message, would he have strength?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Angada had to confess his abilities couldn't be trusted to that extent:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Crossing over to Lanka and carrying back news was a dream distant<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Jambhavan said: "Thousands of years ago, the Lord won a Great War<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I circumambulated the earth and proclaimed His victory without par</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now that I am old, I cannot attempt such a feat<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, there is one amidst us who can do it without getting up heat."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Hanuman here has untold and infinite strength and wit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">By dint of Brahma's word, however, he isn't fully aware of it.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Facing Maruti, Jambhavan said: "You know what you are;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But know not what you may be—trust me, you can go immeasurably far</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You are the son of Anjana, a heavenly lady, who a monkey became</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Your father is Kesari, but you carry the wind god's lineage too, without blame."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Your arms have the strength of ‘<i>Garuda</i>’, the eagle and the Lord's vehicle</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Your speed equals the Wind's; your intelligence and force are too keen to chronicle<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">By Brahma's boon, you are indestructible by any missile</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And by Indra's, you can command your death—trying to kill you is futile</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Concentrate your mind inward and recognise your potential</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Your birth is to serve Rama: remember, your part now is essential."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman did as Jambhavan requested—his powers he discerned</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And swiftly planned a campaign that his group's approval earned</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"At the thought of taking joyful news about Sita to Rama, my heart fills.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I shall assume a huge size and spring into air from the Mahendra Hills.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">After landing in Lanka, I shall conduct my search as per the situation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My mates, pray for good tidings: to our misery, that would be attenuation."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Saying thus, Hanuman quickly expanded himself into a hulk<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And began climbing Mt. Mahendra, subjugating it with his mere bulk</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The mountain, rich in natural assets, began to spit forth its secrets:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Minerals, animals, meditating sages, trees, flowers and leaflets</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When Hanuman pressed down his feet firmly on the mountain's peak</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">It creaked under the impact, which was an occurrence freak.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman stood, a massive silhouette against the sky</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Banging his thighs and shoulders, he let out a whooping cry</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And focusing all his energies, preparatory to flying high<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He supplicated to Rama, by summoning Him to his mind's eye</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The entire creation blessed the most fortunate monkey at this moment:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman, Sitarama's messenger and slave, is a remover of every torment</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
