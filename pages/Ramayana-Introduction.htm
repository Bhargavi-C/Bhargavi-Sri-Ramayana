<p class="p6"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">----------------------</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><b>Sage Narada and Sage Valmiki's Discussion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><b> </b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">One day at Sage Valmiki’s ashram, there arrived a glorious visitor</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The sage was happy to welcome the universal preceptor:</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The ‘Muni pungava’ Narada, the one who dispels ignorance and grants wisdom,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Had come to bless Valmiki with the ‘Sankshepa Ramayanam’</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Valmiki was well-pleased and fell at Narada’s feet,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">He played the perfect host and offered the muni an exalted seat.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Sages always sought knowledge about the Supreme,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">so as to guide all life into the ultimate stream</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Valmiki too was cast in the same mould,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And the highest truth, he waited to be told.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">For, Narada was a devotee par excellence,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">A repertoire of wisdom who could impart true sense.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">“Who is the ‘Gunavaan’, the One with the famed sixteen virtues?</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Is there someone, on this earth, at this time whom you can choose?”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Thus asked Valmiki of Narada, with bent back and covered mouth,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And waited with bated breath for the precious answer to pour forth.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Narada’s eyes welled up and tears flowed fast</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">till he could neither speak nor stand, ruminating on the Resort last.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">“Let me recollect,” Narada said in a choked voice:</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">But, not because he had to make a choice.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">He knew Rama to fit Valmiki’s description and beyond,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And bringing His form to his mind’s eye, he was overcome by thoughts fond:</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Continued the radiant sage: “Give me a moment, O child,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">my joy is running boundless and wild.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Valmiki, meanwhile, was amazed at what he saw:</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">He had always thought sages are ‘Gyanis’ who neither cry nor thaw.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Devotion and surrender were new to him,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">He was yet to transcend knowledge's rim.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Only then did he learn that knowledge ripens into devotion,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">and that exalted tears are its beginning and conclusion.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Narada’s face became suffused</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">with a delight pure, as he mused.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">He then spoke: “Yes indeed, there is One,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama is His name; He comes of the Ikshvaku dynasty and is Dasaratha’s son.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">He has superior qualities that are too numerous to count,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And has not a single bad quality he must surmount.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">He is the embodiment of 'Sousheelya,'</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The quality of mingling with all without high-low criteria."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Went on Narada with enthusiasm, "Let me recount the story of Rama;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">That has it all—Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The précis of the Ramayana Narada now told</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">It became the prelude to the story Valmiki was to unfold.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">-------------------------</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><b>Sankshepa Ramayana (The Précis of the Ramayana)</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">It was a period when virtues had begun to dwindle—the ‘Thretha Yuga’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The era that had dawned after more than seventeen lakh years of ‘Satya Yuga’</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">‘Sriman Narayana,’ the Absolute Divinity, had incarnated twice in the ‘Thretha’ age</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">As ‘Vamana’ and ‘Parasurama’ to conquer the evil causing ‘Dharmic’ damage <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Eventually, the time came for the Lord to appear again—as Sri Rama, the Divine Man<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And events began to transpire to make way for His birth in the Ikshvaku clan</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">As the crowning jewel of the Ikshvakus did Rama appear</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Possessing immaculate qualities, he stood without a peer.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">His appearance, valour, manner, and character—</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Everything about Rama was exquisite like nectar.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">His knowledge of the scriptures and skills in archery</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Were too great to admit rivalry.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Dasaratha, an eminent scion of the Raghu clan</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Ruled Ayodhya for a sixty-thousand year span<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">To that distinguished king were born four illustrious sons</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama, Lakshmana, Bharatha and Shatrughna who shone like suns</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The four became experts in warfare and other princely pursuits</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">To their loving and humble qualities, there were no substitutes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Emperor Dasaratha decided to crown Rama future King</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And set the coronation for an auspicious day in spring.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">But Kaikeyi, his queen, claimed two boons given her long ago:</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Bharatha must be King and Rama into fourteen years of exile, must go</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The hapless King, bound by his word,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Banished 'Raghava' to the forest and fell like a wounded bird.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">While Rama got ready to fulfil His father's command;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">To accompany Him was His brother Lakshmana's only demand.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama's doting wife Sita too decided to follow Her consort:</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Her firm resolution, none could distort.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Ayodhya's citizens also went with the three virtuous ones</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">They could ill-bear separation from their Princess and Dasaratha's sons.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Swiftly sped Rama in a chariot driven by Sumantra,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Stopping at Shringiberapura with the tribal chief Guha.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama then sent Sumantra back with a soothing missive to His father,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And to preclude constant visitors, He went on farther.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">On Sage Bharadwaja's advice, He moved to the Chitrakoota forest,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And there lived happily with His wife and brother, dearest.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Sumantra returned and conveyed Rama's resolution<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Upon hearing it, Dasaratha gave up his life in piteous lamentation.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The noble Bharatha stood steadfast in refusing the kingdom</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">He only desired a place under Rama's Feet, being the epitome of wisdom.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">He sought Rama and begged Him to accept Ayodhya's throne</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">But, Rama refused, wanting to complete the exile as He had sworn.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Seeing Bharatha stubborn and reading his mind,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama bestowed His sandals on his brother, being kind.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Said He: "Till I return, let these 'Paduka' rule on my behalf."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Bharatha left, reluctant but staunch, crying like a bereft calf.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">He lived away from Ayodhya at Nandigrama, a village</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And awaited Rama's return, dressing and living like a sage.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Meanwhile, Rama went even farther, on to the Dandaka forest;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">He thought, “Residing far from My kingdom is best.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Soon, Rama killed the cursed Viradha and visited many sages</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">He learned about the demons torturing them for ages.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Sage Agastya bestowed on Rama weapons capable of wiping sorrows—</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Namely, Indra's bow, sword, and two ever-replenishing quivers of arrows.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama took a noble vow, to eliminate the cruel demon race</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And awaited an opportunity to bring them down in disgrace</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">He disfigured Shurpanaka, the guise-changing demoness,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Among her enormous army Rama scattered death like largesse</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Shurpanaka's vindictive brother Ravana, wanted to harm Him,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And sought help from Mareecha, who changed forms at whim.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">While Mareecha distracted the valiant brothers, Rama and Lakshmana,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Ravana abducted Sita, being an evil demon given to "Kama."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Jatayu, the vulture king, fought Ravana, with great pluck<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And informed Rama of Sita's abduction, despite being fatally struck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama lamented His losses, but soon recollected Himself;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">He vowed to rescue Sita, indistinguishable from His self.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Searching for Sita, Rama and Lakshmana wandered far and wide</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And saw Kabandha, engaged in plunder and covered in gruesome hide</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">When Rama killed and cremated him, he rose heavenward and directed:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">"You must meet Shabari, an old ascetic woman, most blessed."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama visited Shabari and accepted her loving hospitality</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">At Lake Pampa, He met Hanuman, the monkey with enormous vitality.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Hanuman took the resplendent brothers to Sugriva, his chief,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">His story, ending with Sita's abduction, Rama then narrated in brief</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Presently Rama and Sugriva swore alliance before a fire:</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And forged a friendship of which they would never tire</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Sugriva explained in detail the feud with his brother Vali</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Loyal Rama promised to punish the monkey King for his cruel folly</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Sugriva then challenged Vali to combat</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Vali raged: "Where from gets his new courage, the rat?"</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Tara, his clever wife, warned him of Rama's invincible power</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">But, Vali, failing to heed her, rushed out: alas, to return never.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The monkey brothers then clashed fiercely</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama's arrow pierced Vali and took his life deftly.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama established Sugriva as the King of Kishkinda</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Next, Sugriva helped locate the princess of Mithila</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Monkey armies he sent in every possible direction,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">They were to search for mother Sita, that was the sole condition.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Sampati, the elder brother of Jatayu, pointed to Sita at Lanka</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Hanuman leaped across the intervening ocean, fully a hundred Yojana.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Soon Hanuman spotted Sita in Ravana's Asoka garden</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">A personification of chastity, patience and pardon.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Hanuman slowly went up to her and presented Rama's ring;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And when he described Rama, Sita rejoiced as though it were spring.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Then Hanuman began wrecking trees, wanting to gauge Ravana's strength</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">To fight and quell him came demon after demon, at length.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Hanuman rampaged and routed several powerful demon captains</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And pretended to yield to Indrajit's weapon, though capable of smashing mountains</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The son of Ravana took the monkey to his father's presence</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And there Hanuman, with the demon king, held an audience</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">He then burnt Lanka with his tail, which the demons had set ablaze</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">But ensured Sita remained safe while Lanka's citizens went into a daze</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The venerable ‘vanara’ then returned to Rama, all jubilant,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">"Seen Sita," he announced being sensitive and intelligent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama, with Sugriva and the other monkeys reached the ocean shore</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Vibhishana, Ravana's virtuous brother, sought succour at Rama's door.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama next prayed to the ocean-god, and when he failed to appear,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The enraged Lord swore to make him forever disappear.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The ocean-god relenting, sought pardon and shelter</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And suggested Rama build a bridge over his calmed water</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The monkeys laboured eagerly in the Lord's service</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The opportunity to serve Rama, no one wanted to miss.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Raghuveera, the brave lion, vanquished Ravana in battle,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Though victorious, something yet remained for Him to settle.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">That Sita must prove Her spotlessness, Rama did indicate</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">She entered fire instantly: to Her Husband She was ever ready to supplicate<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The fire-god couldn't harm Her, the embodiment of chastity,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama took Her back gladly, having established Sita’s purity</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama then placed Vibhishana on Lanka's throne and pronounced him King</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">With God-given boons, the dead monkeys to life did He then bring.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama stepped into the ‘Pushpaka,’ the divine aircraft,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Towards Ayodhya, He ordered it to quickly waft.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">En route, He visited Bharadwaja, the omniscient sage</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And sent Hanuman ahead to meet Bharatha with a pleasing message</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama followed later in the ‘Pushpaka Vimana’ with His supporters, faithful</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">To be reunited with His brothers, firm and ever truthful.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Soon, Rama removed His matted locks and also His hermit raiment</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">His brothers followed suit, to the citizens' untold joy and merriment.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Then the valiant Raghuveera and Sita attired themselves in regal splendour</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And ascended the throne majestically in glory and grandeur.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Then predicted Narada, the sage who could, time and space, pierce:</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">"To the ‘Parabrahma Loka’ Rama would journey, after ruling for eleven thousand years."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">He also said: "Rama Rajya will remain an ideal to emulate</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">For eons to come, people's admiration it will stimulate.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The holy Ramayana eradicates sins</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Being in conformance with the Veda, wise hearts it wins.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Anyone who engages with this story of Rama, as it happened,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">In the highest echelons of this world and the next, would be positioned."</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><b>Valmiki Receives a Boon from Lord Brahma</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Soon after Narada's benevolent visit, Valmiki one day saw</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">A hunter striking down a bird, a ‘krauncha.’</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The dead bird's poor mate let out agonised cries;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">They stirred sage Valmiki deeply, though he was devoid of ties.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Valmiki called loudly for destruction upon the hunter's head,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And walked away with a swift and furious tread.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The sage turned unhappy with his outburst</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Though the curse had been an elegant verse and his very first.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Because, instead of being a blessing auspicious,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">It had turned out a malediction, most pugnacious.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Valmiki thought: "Its grammar, metre and words are perfect,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Yet, it's not something the wise would respect."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The sage returned to his 'ashram' and sat brooding over his haste</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Presently Lord Brahma appeared and said: “Your verse shall not go to waste.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">He then rearranged Valmiki's words—now they extolled Rama as the best—</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">and bade the Sage compose The Ramayana with zest *<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Thus did the seed get sown<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">for the towering “ithihasa” of renown.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Brahma next bestowed a boon—"You can comprehend through your mind's vision</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Everything Rama thought, said, and did, without omission.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The Ramayana would live as long as Dharma prevails</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">People would turn to it as an answer to all travails.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">You will render the Ramayana as a service to mankind, oh Valmiki,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Your fame shall continue to live for one and all to see."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">---------------------------</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><b>Valmiki begins the great work<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">With Narada, the preceptor's blessing and Brahma's boon,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The Sri Ramayana, Valmiki got ready to compose and tune.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">He closed his eyes and controlled his faculties,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And instantly began to experience Rama without any difficulties.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">What he saw and heard and felt, the sage wrote down in song,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And became steeped in divinity and devotion before long.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">As he lived with Rama, the all-pervading super-soul</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Valmiki transcended the (im)material and catapulted towards his goal.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">From him dripped words of nectar with esoteric meaning,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Vying to talk about Surrender—the culmination of all learning.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The greatness of Rama, Sita or Their devotees—who can decide</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Which of these, in the Ramayana, do reside?</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The Ramayana showcases many ‘Surrenders’ through its length</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Some of these bore fruit, while others lacked that strength</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The demigods' surrender to Sriman Narayana for saving the pious succeeded</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">But, Dasaratha's surrender to Parasurama for sparing Rama proved deluded</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama accepted Lakshmana's surrender and took him on His exile</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">But, He chose to decline Bharatha's tearful surrender to overrule Kaikeyi's guile</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Vibhishana's surrender, the central point of the Ramayana,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Demonstrates in full the components of the 'Sharanagati tatva':</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">“Do what the Lord likes and refrain from what He does not</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Place resolute faith in Him and pray for His merciful onslaught</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Tell Him there is nothing to offer and place the soul at His feet”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">By doing these six, one completes the best possible feat.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama's surrender, the final one, to the ocean King failed miserably:</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">What answered to the others couldn't relieve the super-soul even tolerably!</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Just like the thread of surrender runs through and binds this superior narrative</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">So does the Lord permeate and connect the universe in a manner superlative</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The fruit of learning the Ramayana is the inclination</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">For 'Sharanagati' and ultimate salvation.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><b>----------------------------</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><b>Lava Kusha Narrate the Sri Ramayana</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><b> </b></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Valmiki composed the Sri Ramayana in several thousand verses</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Of these, twenty four thousand stand, to annihilate earth's curses.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">After Valmiki completed the epic, Lava and Kusha, the twin sons of Rama</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Learnt to sing the Ramayana, while growing up in the sage's ‘ashrama.’</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama had banished Sita to the forests when she was pregnant</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">She had taken refuge at Valmiki's hut, which was with divinity, vibrant.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">At various places did Lava-Kusha sing the ballad pure</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Whoever heard it shed tears of joy for sure.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">One day a happy sage gave them a hearty blessing:</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">"The Hero of the epic will hear you sing."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The blessing came true when to Ayodhya the lads came</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">They were taken to the Royal assemblage where sat Rama of fame.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Rama saw the children and was struck by their appearance<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">They looked like effulgent hermits and bold warriors at once</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">And when they embarked on singing His story</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Sita's Husband became ecstatic, listening to Her glory.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">As the Ramayana's verses flowed to music mellifluous<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">The people gathered forgot Rama and began listening to His tale glorious.</span></p>
