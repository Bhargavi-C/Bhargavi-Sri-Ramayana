<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i> </i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b><i>Prelude:</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Hanuman goes to Lanka in search of Sita by leaping across the ocean<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>He spots and gives Her Rama's ring like a life-infusing potion</i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Sita in turn hands over her ornament and sends Her husband a request:</i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Only a month would she wait for Rama's arrival and Ravana's conquest</i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Hanuman advises Ravana to surrender but has his tail set to flame</i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Unaffected, he returns to Rama and conveying Sita's message, earns fame.</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i> </i></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>The Story in Detail:</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b> </b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman began growing, like an ocean tide on a full moon night</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Stopping only when his dimensions were sufficient for his flight</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The great simian then shook his hair, and his body he quivered</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He roared loudly, and at his dormant power, the world shivered</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman’s long tail coiled and moved, like a sinuous snake:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">It had work to do in Lanka—it would set the place ablaze in its wake</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The '<i>pavana suta</i>' Hanuman, the wind god's son stood tall</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"I shall bring Sita back or Ravana, if I fail to find her," was his call</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Then crouching and placing his hands down for stability</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The intelligent monkey assumed a pose suited for aerial mobility</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Looking at his mountain-like form, the well-wishers of Earth were pleased</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Owing to this Hanuman, from Ravana's grip, the world will be released."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Meditating on Rama, Hanuman made a mighty leap and became air-borne</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">From the force of his jump, mighty trees were uprooted and torn</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Flowers dislodging from them scattered and to Hanuman they clung</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He resembled a giant cloud cut by lightning: the sight was fit to be sung</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Many trees followed his flight like relatives reluctant to separate</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The disturbance caused the dwellers of Mt. Mahendra to flee, desperate<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The flying Hanuman shone golden like ‘<i>Garuda</i>’, the Lord's carrier</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">It was apparent to every onlooker that nothing to him could be a barrier</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman’s form in the sky entered and exited clouds and the wind sang loud</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">His shadow on the ocean's surface looked like a dense cloud</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Maruti's eyes twinkled bright like the sun and the moon</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He zoomed forth like a meteor anxious to reach the earth soon</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman's stretched limbs were like powerful logs cleaving the air</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The water beneath sprang up in high tides, a sight rare</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The creatures of the sea—crocodiles, whales, and turtles—stood revealed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">‘Samudra’, Ikshvaku's friend, approached ‘Mainaka’ and appealed:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"The wind God helped you, a massive mountain, hide here from Indra's fury</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We must help Hanuman, his son, who strives for Rama's glory."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The Mainaka Mountain complied with the ocean's request and rose</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">It intercepted Hanuman and said: "Rest on me; take a refreshing doze</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The ocean God and I want to help you, Rama's staunch devotee<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We have kinship with your father and the respected Ikshvaku dynasty."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman thanked the duo and touched the mountain with respect</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He replied: "Until I complete Rama's task, every interruption I must reject."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Mainaka and Samudra became delighted at Hanuman's perseverance</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">They blessed him with good luck and gave him reassurance:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"You will find Sita and return to Rama with Her message</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">With your intelligence, the couple's sorrows you will assuage."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman continued his journey with renewed hope and firmness</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He was keen to ascertain Sita's welfare and ruminated on Rama with fondness</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The chiefs of heavenly abodes wanted to gauge Hanuman's capacity—</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">They enlisted Surasa, the mother of '<i>nagas</i>', to test Hanuman's sense and tenacity</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Surasa, assuming a monster's form, rose in front of Hanuman and challenged:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Any one who crosses my path must enter my mouth" said she and lunged</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman became bigger but Surasa only widened her mouth further</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now, quickly shrinking, Hanuman entered her mouth and out did he slither</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman's wit and presence of mind pleased the heaven's residents</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">They felt he would get the better of Ravana, though there were no precedents</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Anjaneya got their best wishes and continued his flight relentlessly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Next, he fought ‘Simihika’, the demoness who clutched at shadows, fearlessly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When she held him back, Hanuman entered her innards and rend her heart:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Thus, he lived up to expectations and overcame every obstacle on his part</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Soon, Hanuman neared the island of Lanka and spotted its coastline</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He saw the place covered in lush green and like a large emerald shine</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"I must reduce my size as I land," thought Hanuman with caution</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Before I locate Sita, none should spot me," was his wary notion</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Thus, Hanuman assumed his usual size as he came down on a mountain</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He made a survey of his surroundings and in his mind organised his intention</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Lanka proved a veritable paradise with its gloriously planned layout</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“No doubt, Lanka seems like heaven on earth!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman thought thus and waited for dark to venture into the city:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He judged it wise to roam Lanka when daylight dimmed in intensity</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, when at dusk, he presented himself at the city's gate</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He was stopped by the hideous ‘Lankini,’ who protected Lanka's fate.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The ogress challenged Hanuman and asked for his identity</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman brought her down with a blow, thus launching Lanka's calamity</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Lankini’s eyes started from their spheres and she stared wildly</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Her knotted locks parted and each hair stood on end, rigidly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">She looked like a porcupine frightened in its rambles:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Her hair resembled its quills and lay about in shambles</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The peerless monkey then began searching far and wide and high and low</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But failing to locate Sita, he felt his cheer ebb and his wit refusing to flow</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Earlier, he had mistaken for Sita a ravishing woman in Ravana’s private mansion</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But had realised his folly and thought:  “Rama’s wife won’t act in this fashion. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The incomparable Sita must have defied the wicked Ravana's demands</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And the helpless lady probably perished at the unscrupulous ogre’s hands.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman thought along these lines and fell into a deep gloom</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">How could he return to Rama and announce such awful doom?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Soon, however, he recovered his courage and became optimistic</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He decided: "Searching again with a fine-toothed comb would be pragmatic.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I pray to Thee O Rama, may my mission be successful<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">O Sita, please reveal Thyself: heed my request, humble and respectful."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">At once, Hanuman discerned a charming grove full of Asoka trees</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hidden from open view, it lay cloistered in illusory peace</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Certain he would see Sita, Hanuman entered this garden<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Almost instantly, from a tree top he spied her, dusty and emaciated with grief’s burden</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman saw in Sita the personification of chaste merit</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He thought: “Separated from such a wife, how lives Rama’s spirit?”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“In every way, Rama and Sita are made for each other</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">In beauty, birth, age, virtues, and thought, they match one another.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When Hanuman marvelled thus, Rama smiled to Himself<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And thought: “I wanted you to see Sita’s speciality yourself</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">That is why, beloved Hanuman, I chose you to carry my message</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My sleepless agitation, you will comprehend and no longer disparage.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">About the best way to reveal his form, Hanuman sat contemplating</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“I mustn’t jump in front of Sita suddenly: she might fall down swooning.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">While he was pondering thus, there was sudden furore in the place</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita began trembling and perturbation came upon Her face</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">As Hanuman watched, a majestic demon with ten heads appeared</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“He must be Ravana,” Hanuman thought and behind thick branches disappeared</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Ravana began to plead with Sita for Her graces and said:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“Be my wife, and upon every type of riches, you shall tread.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita placed between Herself and the demon a blade of grass<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And started to advice him in words that showed Her superlative class</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“Turn your mind away from me; I am solely Rama’s property</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Place your focus on your wives and children and stick to propriety.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Why did Sita put a blade of grass in front of her before speaking?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Her chastity forbade her from addressing Ravana, a male ill meaning</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Also, as a royal lady, she knew the etiquette she must observe</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Ravana was a king and in lieu of a seat she offered grass, though with reserve</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">By placing the grass, between Ravana and herself, Sita created a screen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">She wanted her attitude of formality and distance to be seen</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Further, it was a warning to Ravana that Rama would mitigate him into grass</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita also indicated that like worthless grass, Ravana’s riches were crass</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita moreover pointed out that Ravana was acting like a mindless beast:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">That’s why she offered him grass, the food on which bovine creatures feast</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Finally, Sita signaled to Ravana that his threat about killing her was in vain</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Because, life without Rama was as grass to her, and she would rather be slain.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita addressed stern words to Ravana and said: “Foul deeds will rise</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Though you try to overwhelm them, to good men’s eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama will come to know where I am and who you are</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">All tongues speak of His valour and yet with Him you wait to spar?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">A wise man matches his thoughts and words to his action<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, though claiming to be brave, you used guile, careless of repercussion.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“Return me to Rama and ask for His pardon, holding His hand in friendship</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Be rational and realise, in fear lies your best safety, and escape from hardship.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Remember, my Rama is a He-elephant in rut; you, a mere hare</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I do not jest with you: he will crush you and lay Lanka bare.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Is there none to give you good advice and save you from destruction?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Alas, even if there were, you would not listen to their instruction.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">On the contemptible and grovelling Ravana, patient and sage advice Sita poured:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">She is like a rain cloud, which its goodness can never hoard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Though Ravana was undeserving to even fall at Rama’s feet for clemency</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita suggested he hold Rama’s hand, knowing well Her husband’s tendency:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama had a generous heart that practised camaraderie on the humblest creature</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He would not approve of Ravana falling at His feet, given the ‘<i>rakshasa’</i>s’ stature</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita raised doubts about the presence of wise heads in Ravana’s kingdom</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Because, of virtuous folk, his monster-like behaviour gave no symptom</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Then she remembered Vibhishana, Ravana’s brother, most righteous,</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Who had declared to Ravana that separating Sita from Rama was foolishness</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Recollecting his irreproachable character, Sita amended her complaint:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">As Ravana’s end was near, his only good counsellor failed to be a restraint</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita struggled to reform Ravana, her senses in turmoil</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">His maleficent intentions baffled, Ravana’s emotions were in a boil</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman felt wretched: "O that I could intervene and crush the offender!"</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Evidently, misery into several lives a single act of sin does render</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Finally, Ravana gave Sita two months to change her mind:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“Else, I shall kill you,” he threatened, shameless and unrefined.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">As soon as he left, Sita shed tears of agony and fear</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">She concluded: "Death alone can give me succour.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Using my own long and curly hair as rope<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Let me hang myself from a tree: I have lost all hope."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Divining her thought, Hanuman began to panic</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And considered: "At this crucial moment, Rama’s name alone would prove a tonic."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita spoke to Herself: “What should be my fear?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I do not care for life, not when my Rama is not near.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">What can death do to my soul?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">It is a thing immortal as death’s own toll.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">O Sun, your uprise I shall see no more:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Fortune and I part here: my affliction is sore.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Just then, in a sweet, low voice, Hanuman began to sing Rama’s glory</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">As Sita listened with rapt attention, She forgot her state sorry</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Continuing to sing Rama’s name, Hanuman descended from his perch</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He stood at Sita’s feet with folded palms, having concluded his search</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Taken aback, Sita thought in disbelief and dismay:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“Is this a demon in disguise or is my mind going astray?”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">By recounting incidents pertaining to Rama, Sita's doubts Hanuman dispelled</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Rama collaborated with Sugriva the monkey King so 'Dharma' can be upheld"</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita heard Hanuman’s narrative with an incredulous elation</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">She said: “You have saved my life and Rama’s too, with your devoted oration.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You might be a god, or a monkey, or even a demon: it is no matter</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Chanting my Lord’s sweet name, into my parched mind, you’ve splashed nectar.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman earned the eternal gratitude and praise of the universal mother<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“May smooth success be strewed before your feet: like you, there is no other.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita then asked: “Please describe Rama’s figure and physical attributes</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I am eager to know His wellbeing and whether He remembers me in His pursuits.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman replied: “With my ability for speech, I could describe anything</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, to compare with Rama’s handsome form, there simply is nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“However, I will attempt to tell thee about His physique flawless</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">His body is well proportioned and majestic, like a tiger reckless</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Resembling the full moon are His luminous face and sparkling teeth</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">One look at his snake-like coils of hair: and creatures forget to breathe<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">His nose resembles a creeper; His eyes are its lotus blooms</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">His red and full mouth is its fruit that in loveliness looms.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“But, all this beauty has waned since You were torn away</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Today, He remains listless and to perpetual melancholy, he is prey.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He neither eats nor sleeps nor does He involve in any light-hearted activity</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Even if He falls into a doze, He wakes up calling for you, like a bird in captivity</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The acute suffering of Rama is there for everyone to see</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, He has left no stone unturned in His mission to set you free.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hearing Hanuman speak, Sita felt happy and sad at the same time</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Her heart already full of Rama beat for Him like a mournful chime</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">That Her husband should be distraught in Her absence made Her smile</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The thought of His pangs however brought tears to Her eyes meanwhile</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now, Hanuman retrieved Rama’s ring from his safe keeping</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He put it into Sita’s hands and set Her passionately weeping<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita hugged the ring to Her breast and patted Her eyes with it</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">She touched it to Her forehead and Her quivering lip she bit</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita remembered Rama’s hands and shoulders as also His touch</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">She brought to mind His supple form: His ring became Her crutch<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita stood still as though she were embracing Her husband tight</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman looked on with a heaving heart at this touching sight</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">A story known only to Rama, Sita and Lakshmana, Hanuman now narrated</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"It seems one day you and Rama swam in the river Godavari and contested.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Lakshmana became the referee and sat upon a boulder</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You swam slowly with delicate strokes; Rama was swifter</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, out of love for you, He let you win and lost the competition<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You mocked at Him and laughed aloud, earning Rama's admiration."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Rama recollected this happy incident and asked me to recount it to you</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">While doing so, He became incensed and roared: 'I shall give the ogres their due.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Let them return Sita to me with her beautiful laughter this very night</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Or I shall change the map of this earth, with my bow tip's might.'</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva and Lakshmana pacified Rama and requested Him to simmer down</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When I take back news about you, His sorrow Rama will drown."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">After Hanuman had delivered Rama's message, Sita enquired:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"How did you cross this ocean formidable? Are you not tired?"</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman replied: "I expanded myself and flew across quickly</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">With Rama's ring on my person, I accomplished this task effortlessly."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">At Sita's request Hanuman then displayed his form gigantic<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"You're bigger than '<i>Varaha</i>', the boar incarnation," admired Sita, ecstatic.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"How did Rama befriend Sugriva without my inducing?" Sita queried<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">About Rama's benevolence in Her absence, She felt curious and worried</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The <i>‘shastras’ </i>are texts that explain the Lord’s nature<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">They state: ‘Lakshmi’s bond with Narayana never does rupture’</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Unless the Lord is with His consort, His deeds are unreliable</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Compassion and punishment: from Him anything is possible</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita was concerned about the scriptures being reworded:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">For creatures to earn God’s leniency, was she no longer needed?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman appeased her: "Only through you, Rama and we came together</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The bundle You dropped had Your blessings and helped us foregather."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita heaving a sigh of relief, began recounting a particular incident:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“Once, while at Ayodhya, I and Rama had a quarrel, a rare event.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“Rama flicked my '<i>kumkum</i>' the decorative powder for married women</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I stopped talking to Him, considering it a silly act and an ill omen.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">After a couple of days of ignoring each other, we calmed down</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama dropped His ring deliberately and asked, "Where’s my ring?" with a frown</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I pretended to locate His ring: it had brought us together then</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But now, though I have the ring, I wonder if I shall see Him and when.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">That loyal monkey thought, "Why must Sita worry here till Rama arrives?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Let me take Her back: that way, pleasure Rama, Sita and everyone derives."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman said to Sita: "O mother, please climb and sit on my back<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You shall meet Rama in a short while and forget this life black."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita refused: "Hanuman, I won't touch another male of my own volition</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hence, I cannot accept your offer on any condition."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman laughed and said: "You are making an excuse flimsy</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You are mother to the world; hence, touching me cannot make you uneasy."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">At this Sita replied: "But, I shall be scared of the ocean and might fall</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And with me on your back, any pursuing demons, how will you stall?"</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman denied these arguments too and contended:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Please tell the real reason, lady: enough have You pretended."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"This universe is Yours and You cannot be scared of an ocean</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And being omniscient, that You doubt my ability to fight, is a ludicrous notion."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sita confessed: "The evil Ravana, I myself could have easily destroyed.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To turn him into ashes, the sheer power of my mind, I could have employed.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, I do not depend on my capabilities nor look to anyone's hands</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My sole support and protection is Rama: I shall wait till here He lands."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman understood: surrendering to the Lord and depending on Him is balm</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Trying to help oneself, being against inherent nature, is likely to end in harm</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Circumambulating Sita and bowing to Her feet, Hanuman prepared to leave</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Please give a token of identification for Rama—you need not grieve."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> Sita gave Hanuman a jewel from Her hair and narrated another story</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"This incident known only to me and Rama, like ever, speaks His glory."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Once, at Chitrakoota, Rama rested with His head on my lap</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I sat still, fanning Him and gazing happily on His handsome map.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Suddenly, a demonic crow swooped down and came at me with lust</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I tried to shoo it, but blood started dripping as it pecked at my breast<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama woke up and charged a blade of grass with the power of a weapon</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He released it and let it go after the crow, who was a disguised demon</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"The crow flew all over the world, requesting protection<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And finally went to Lord Brahma himself, seeking to avoid destruction<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Brahma advised him: "Ask for pardon at Rama's feet, the ultimate resting place."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The crow fell at Rama's feet and placed on Him its claws instead of its face</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I turned its face to Rama's feet and requested: "Forgive the misled creature."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama's weapon poked its eye, but spared its life—testimony to Rama's nature."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"One more incident let me recount for Rama's pleasure</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">At Chitrakoota lived a parrot who amused us when we were at leisure</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We wanted to give it a name and all three of us pondered</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama said, 'Let us name it Kaikeyi, our mother must be honoured.'</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This is my husband's tender heart that knows no animosity<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">In my Rama's nature, there is nothing but high-minded generosity."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"May fortune be yours, Hanuman! Give Rama my Jewel and my stories</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Tell Him I shall not live beyond a month surviving these demons' furies</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I worry how Rama and Lakshmana will reach Lanka by crossing the sea<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You must place them on your shoulders and bring them over with glee."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman replied: "With Rama leading us, our monkey army can cross any ocean<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Just await your liberation: to remain anxious now, there is no reason!"</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“Till Rama comes, I must cling on to life,” spoke Sita to Her mind</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman, meanwhile considered: "Ravana's might, I must find.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The best way to do it would be by creating a ruckus<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Let me begin by destroying this garden and making a fuss."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman assumed a big size and started uprooting trees</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The demonesses and demons guarding the place, he began to seize.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The scared fiends ran to their chiefs and reported the rampage</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The demon leaders came to investigate and witnessed Hanuman's rage</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama's messenger killed many, among them Akhsha Kumara, Ravana's son</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To combat Hanuman, then came Indrajit, Ravana's favourite scion</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Indrajit released <i>'Brahmastra'</i> the weapon having Lord Brahma's force</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Pretending capitulation stood that monkey of sagacious resource.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Maruti wanted to meet Ravana quickly and reveal Rama's intention</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He would warn him about Rama's impending intervention</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He allowed himself to be dragged in ropes to Ravana's Royal assembly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When he saw the unprincipled King, he could barely control his fury</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Ravana commanded Hanuman to speak and explain his offence</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman announced: "I'm Srirama's messenger; into you, I'll knock some sense."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"I am Hanuman, the minister of Sugriva, Vali's brother</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">For his wrongdoing, Rama dispatched Vali to realms farther."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When Ravana heard this information, his body jolted in shock</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Has Vali really been killed? Or me, do you dare mock?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman replied: "With a single arrow of Rama's, Vali was felled</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Remind yourself: you lost to Vali once; by false complacence, don't be lulled."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"You can retain your life and save from obliteration, your kith and kin</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Return Sita with reverence to Rama and repent for your sin."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Ravana laughed with derision; his mind blocked by lust</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He said: "To a puny human's whims, my actions I refuse to adjust.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Here, kill this insolent monkey right at this spot</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Let his mission to report Sita's whereabouts come to naught."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Vibhishana, Ravana's younger brother, was steeped in justice</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He cried: “O brother, killing an envoy is unfair: you will land in a crisis</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Let him go back to the princes and give an account of your strength</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And explain the difficulty of reaching Lanka, crossing the ocean’s length.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Ravana agreed with Vibhishana and Hanuman’s life he decided to spare<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He however commanded: “Set the ape’s tail on fire–it will give him a good scare.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, when Hanuman’s tail was set ablaze, he climbed high on to a roof</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And setting the entire city on fire, of his prowess he gave proof</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Suddenly, Hanuman recalled Sita and worried about Her fate<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He rushed to the Asoka garden, bitterly regretting his haste</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">However, Sita was well and said: "I've commanded Fire not to burn you</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">You will be Rama's servitor forever and remain under His benevolent view."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman touched Sita's feet with reverence and bade farewell</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He was eager to meet his group and his sweet news tell</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rushing to the mountain near the ocean coast, Hanuman grew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">In no time, he reached the ocean's other shore and sighted his anxious crew</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The monkeys had been waiting for Hanuman's arrival without food and water</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Seeing Hanuman's approach, they thrilled and began to chatter</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Jambhavan detected success from Hanuman's jubilant attitude<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He cried, "Hanuman has surely seen Sita safe; we owe him our gratitude."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman landed amidst his clamorous comrades with a gleeful yell</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The monkeys began to jump in delight when he announced, "All is well."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The group wasted no time in heading back to where Rama was</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">On their way, 'Madhuvana', Sugriva's fruit garden did they pass</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The hungry simians decided to sate their hunger and thirst<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Into that precious and favourite garden of Sugriva’s, they burst</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Ransacking the trees and plucking the fruits, the monkeys made merry</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To stop their frenzy, 'Dadimukha', the caretaker of the garden did hurry</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">But, the monkeys failed to listen to the warnings of Sugriva's uncle</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">So, he hurried to Sugriva and said, "Your boisterous army, I cannot tackle."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"They arrived a while ago and are destroying your favourite garden of fruits</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My appeals went unheeded: I failed to control the fermenting brutes."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">On hearing Dadimukha's account, Sugriva began leaping<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">He ran to a rock and upon it, his tail he started beating</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">A bemused Rama exclaimed: "Your favourite garden is being wrecked</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">And here you are running amok with happiness unchecked!"</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sugriva came to Rama with a beaming face and said:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">"Sita is well—that's why our army is celebrating without dread</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">They know anyone who dares disobey my orders gets the noose</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">They are well past their time limit—and yet they run loose</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">That means Sita's welfare is ascertained<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Understandably, their joy and pride they have not contained."</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Just then Jambhavan, Hanuman, Angada and the others arrived</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Upon perceiving their joyful expressions, a modicum of relief Rama derived</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">One by one the monkeys who went in search of Sita came up to Rama<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">They thumped His back in excitement and said: “Found Sita,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Those present there felt, “It’s a good thing, at ‘Madhuvana’ the monkeys stopped</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Else, even more forceful slaps, on Rama's back they would have dropped!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama watched contentedly as all the monkey folk competed</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To tell the news of Sita and see His face light up, elated</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Finally, Hanuman came near Rama and said: “I saw Sita face to face</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">She sat like the statue of chastity, and of cheer, she had no trace.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">She was soiled and worn, and expects your arrival every moment</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Her jewel and an imploring message, through me she sent.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman then handed Rama the jewel from Sita’s hair</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">On seeing it, Rama swooned, stricken by thoughts of His mate fair</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Reviving soon, He asked Hanuman to describe Sita’s condition:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">“How is Sita bearing up under fate’s cruel assault? I await your rendition”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hanuman said: “Sita is holding on to life with Your thoughts alone</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">She's surrounded by frightening fiends, who for their cruelty, are well known.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Then Hanuman narrated the incidents just as ‘Mythili’ had instructed</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Rama became convinced of the wellbeing of His wife who had been abducted <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
