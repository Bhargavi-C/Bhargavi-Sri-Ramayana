<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>The Story in Detail:</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama, listening to Hanuman's account of Sita, gazed upon him with gratitude</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He heartily embraced and thanked the monkey, looked on by the multitude:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When Hanuman went as Rama’s messenger taking His lotus-eyed blessing</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">All he got was fire to his tail—an event rather distressing</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, when he came as Sita’s messenger, he got Rama’s embrace:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Because Her red-lotus-like eyes always shower compassionate grace.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita’s adored husband then, delayed not an instant<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He led Sugriva and His army for the ocean, distant</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana, Jambhavan, Hanuman, Nala, Nila and other Chiefs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Along with scores of monkeys and bears set out to punish Lanka's thieves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Within twelve days, Rama’s flood-like troops reached the Southern tip</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Now Rama pondered: “We must reach Lanka: how to make that trip?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On the other side meanwhile, Ravana prepared for war</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He worried: “Rama’s arrival here, can the ocean mar?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His sanguine courtiers adulated him and denied every danger<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, wise Vibhishana gave advice: “Your life, do not endanger.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama is not an ordinary mortal as you think</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He is Sriman Narayana, in whom everything does sink.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“You have already committed a great sin by snatching Sita away by stealth</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Do as Hanuman suggested: return Her and retain your glory and wealth</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Since the day you brought Rama’s virtuous wife into our terrain<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">There have been bad omens everyday: their message is plain.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Do not listen to the counsel your foolish courtiers and relatives give</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Listen to your conscience and reach Rama: He will forgive.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Repent what is past and avoid what is to come</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Repair your actions and save Lanka from a fate gruesome<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If you do not return Sita, a battle is imminent</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You will fall to earth and mingle in dust: Rama shall be dominant</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Do not spread compost on sinful weeds</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You will only make them ranker with your ill deeds."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With Vibhishana’s advice, Ravana turned furious</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He fumed: “I have nurtured in my bosom a snake injurious</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Instead of supporting me and allaying my fears</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You utter words that are like hot venom to my ears.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana’s son Indrajit too joined in his father’s tirades:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“This uncle of mine always criticises our exploits and crusades.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On Vibhishana, Ravana and his cronies began to heap insults:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They failed to distinguish right from wrong, those retarded adults</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“After eating Ravana’s salt and being his flesh and blood</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You dare speak against him and on his actions throw mud?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Challenged thus by Ravana's unwise kith and kin</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana decided it was time to distance himself from sin.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana, could not digest Vibhishana’s wise counsel</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His ears were sealed against just words because he was a scoundrel</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Even if he didn’t relish righteous advice, he could have imbibed it</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Simply because it was from his own brother with an upright spirit</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, ‘Kaalaa’ or the God of Death had positioned himself in Ravana’s ear:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That is why even a single sane word, he failed to hear.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana decided where his loyalty must lie in this situation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">'Right always comes before relationship' was Vibhishana's contention</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He bowed low to his elder brother and tearfully pledged:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Upon me, disloyalty you and the others have alleged.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Though I did all I can to show you the '<i>Dharmic</i>' track</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Your fate has made you cling to your destructive tack."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">”Alas, I cannot save you from sin; you are destined for pain</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">My life here ceases—I must quickly reach ‘<i>Dharma</i>'s’ domain</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I bid you farewell and liberate myself from here, this very moment</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">My wife, children and family, I give up without further comment</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">From now, my all is Rama, who is every soul's ultimate sustenance<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I leave Lanka with a light heart, without repentance."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Thus said Vibhishana, the perspicacious discerner of truth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And comporting his mind, came over to Rama, the epitome of ruth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana flew holding his mace in a grip steady and powerful<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With him he took four of his followers, true and faithful</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The wise rakshasa now reached Rama's place with folded palms:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Was he glad to be in a camp that listened to younger brothers without qualms!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Every soul is the ‘<i>paramatma</i>’s’ property that none can poach</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana's mace represents the soul that submits to the Lord’s approach</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana, coming to Rama, became ‘<i>Shrimaan</i>’ in the revered Valmiki’s mind:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Because, he realised his spiritual destiny and himself to the Supreme, he did bind</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Thus, Vibhishana became the possessor of wealth of every sort</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And every one of his materialistic snares, he easily did thwart.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The essence of Sri Ramayana is contained in ‘<i>Sharanagati</i>’—that is, surrender</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Embodying all its components, ‘<i>Vibhishana Sharanagati</i>’ stands alone in splendour</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">There are three standard paths that lead to release from the birth cycle:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">‘<i>Karma yoga</i>,’ ‘<i>Gyana yoga</i>’ and ‘<i>Bhakthi yoga</i>’ yield results, more than a trifle</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">‘<i>Karma yoga’</i> needs knowledge of every scripture<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">‘<i>Gyana yoga</i>’ entails thinking incessantly of God’s nature</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">‘<i>Bhakthi yoga</i>’ is love for God mingled with constant thought:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">All three means with difficulties are fraught</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">One needs for ‘Karma yoga’ and ‘Gyana yoga’ thousands of years<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Then, when sins are washed away, the route for ‘Bhakthi yoga’ clears</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Obviously, the three paths call for immense determination and sense control:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">These therefore are difficult to follow for the common soul<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">One finds a house owner attending to his property and caring for it</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If it is damaged or usurped by someone, the owner is badly hit.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Every creation is owned by the '<i>Paramatma</i>' or the Supreme:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Therefore, He worries about them in the extreme</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When His creations fail to reach Him, Narayana, the universal owner, suffers a sense of loss</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To help His children reach Him easily, He paved the ‘<i>Sharanagati</i>’ path, in His mercy without cause</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The first three yogic paths are ‘Saadhyopaya’ that involve one’s own efforts</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">‘<i>Sharanagati</i>’ is ‘Siddhopaya’ a ready-made way with the best of comforts</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Surrender has neither rule nor stipulation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It simply calls for total submission</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Anyone can perform ‘<i>Sharanagati</i>’ for any fruits at anytime from anywhere</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The only condition is: one must direct it towards Narayana, the eternally aware</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">For every person who is convinced about his own inability to reach salvation</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Surrender, with its six components, becomes the simplest solution:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">‘<i>Sharanagati</i>’ involves complete faith that the Lord is the only recourse</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And the prayer that, to break mortal coils, He must be the force</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It means doing what He has ordained and refraining from those He has not</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It requires affirming one’s inability to give anything but the soul without a blot.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">An analogy best describes the Sharanagati dictum:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A baby cat carried by its mother shows perfect wisdom</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Though it seems the mother's jaw might crush the fragile kitten</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She carries it with care and ensures the baby is not bitten</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">All the baby does is give itself up to its mother with credence:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Thus must every soul surrender to the super soul without reluctance.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A baby monkey, on the other hand, takes the onus for its own transport</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As the mother moves, it clings to her tummy for support</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If the baby’s grip falters, down it falls and ends:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Attempting to reach the Lord by one’s own efforts, towards misadventure, tends</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In ‘<i>Sharanagati</i>’, one must adopt the clever kitten’s attitude:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Creator Himself leads the surrendered soul to His feet with rectitude</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A reservoir or tank is another example to clarify the ‘<i>Sharanagati</i>’ principle</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">One digs it to save water during rains, which are unpredictable</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Akin to a tank is one’s announcement of ‘<i>Sharanagati</i>’ or readiness for salvation</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The ‘<i>Paramatma</i>’ bestows His rain-like mercy as per His inclination</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">One cannot dictate when the rain must pour</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, if one fails to build a reservoir, rainwater, he cannot store.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">An additional simile is a man who wants to sit atop an elephant and has two options</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The elephant kneeling and lifting him up or the person using his own contraptions</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Of the two, the former is the better method, easy and free from risk</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, the person must remain still, when the elephant stoops to whisk</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If the man doubts the pachyderm’s intention and tries to act</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He is bound to be dashed to the ground and cannot remain intact</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A ‘<i>Sharanagata</i>’ is a person who is desirous of surrender</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He must have complete faith in the Lord: over this, there can be no blunder<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A child who gets beaten by his mother for mischief</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Does not run away to another’s mother even for a time brief</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In the same manner, a person who has surrendered to God</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Must remain complacent and staunch that His mercy is never flawed</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When a soul surrenders, he realizes that he has nothing to barter<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He shows that to the Lord by ‘<i>Anjali Mudra</i>’, that is, bringing his palms together<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">By putting his feet together and prostrating to the Supreme<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The surrendering person indicates he stays put under His regime</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana’s four followers represented his arms and legs</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Joining them, he had reached Rama, despite having lived among the dregs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana came to Rama shedding every earthly attachment</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He sought Rama's feet as the sole mode for spiritual advancement</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The rakshasa acted in a manner that aligned with the Lord’s will</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And refused to do things that would fit his injunctions ill</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana held his palms together, indicating he had nothing to present</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His soul he offered devoutly, with his wise head bent</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">From Lanka, Vibhishana flew into the air, that rakshasa marked for eternal fame</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b><i>'And to the location where Rama stayed with Lakshmana, he quickly came'</i></b>:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Every one of these words has distinct significance for ‘<i>Jivatma</i>’ in the universe</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The ‘place where Rama is’ removes sin and has sanctity diverse</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">By ‘enlisting a devotee like Lakshmana’ one earns the Lord’s grace easily</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A devotee understands another’s travails and in convincing the Lord, helps readily</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A person’s movements are typically explained relative to his home</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“He has ‘gone’ out” is what describes a person out to roam</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When he returns home, “He has ‘come’” gives his position</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Thus, “Vibhishana” ‘went’ to Rama must have been Valmiki’s narration</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, the high-souled sage sang ‘quickly came to Rama’:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Because Rama is everything, including home, for Vibhishana—and every ‘<i>Jivatma</i>’</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Spotting Vibhishana from afar, the monkeys became agitated</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They began throwing boulders and trees at him, feeling aggravated</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana held his powerful mace between his folded hands</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The monkeys said: “We must destroy that flying ogre, before he lands.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">From the way he wields his mace, this demon’s fighting skills are obvious</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He excels in the usage of many weapons: about this, none can be dubious.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, Vibhishana’s face was tranquil and showed humility and surrender</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The monkeys could perceive his expression, gentle and tender</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Without climbing down from the sky, that ‘<i>rakshasa</i>’ prayed:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Tell Rama, Vibhishana is here—let the information not be delayed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I have renounced my brother Ravana, the kingdom of Lanka and my family</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I have come here, seeking deliverance at Rama’s lotus feet, gladly.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sugriva said: “You must wait, Rama is busy and cannot be disturbed.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, Vibhishana pleaded: “Go at once, before my mind becomes perturbed.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The monkeys went to Rama and delivered Vibhishana’s request</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sugriva cried: “You must kill the rakshasa; he is likely a wicked pest.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">All the elders from the monkey and bear troops agreed with Sugriva’s verdict</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“This is a wrong time and place to surrender: Vibhishana You must evict.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When Sugriva asked for Vibhishana’s execution, Rama’s face turned crimson</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Recognising disapproval, the others monkeys sought only Vibhishana’s expulsion:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Though everyone felt that the ogre must be slain without scruples</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They did not want to hurt Rama who had steadfast principles</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hence, they modified their opinions and softened their demand</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And concluded, “We have said enough Rama; we now await Your command” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hanuman had not spoken a word while the others deliberated</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama said: “Speak Hanuman, why is your opinion unstated?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That wise monkey now replied: “Vibhishana was born under a charitable star.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Though a rakshasa, the evil nature of his tribe, does not him mar.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When I was at Lanka, he spoke against his brother with courage and conviction</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Clearly, he has a sense of right, and he states it without inhibition.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“He must be granted a place at Your lotus feet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I recommend You make him Lanka's King after Ravana’s defeat.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama heard the opinion of every monkey with quiet patience:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He listened to their reasoning without annoyance</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">‘Give everyone your ear and few your voice’: <sup>#</sup></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">By this dictum lived the wise Rama, by choice.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">All the monkeys, including Hanuman, looked at Rama expectantly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His words always sounded like nectar, spoken benignantly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A smiling Rama said, “I shall now state my decision</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I take a half each from Sugriva’s and Hanuman’s suggestion:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I will accept Sugriva’s opinion that Vibhishana has designs fake</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And, Hanuman’s suggestion that he should be included, I will take.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“The fundamental principle of the Ikshvaku race is to bestow protection</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On those who are weak and those who seek it: whatever their station</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I will protect Vibhishana, even if he has intentions hostile</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If I act otherwise, my dynasty and ancestors, I shall defile</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Whatever might be Vibhishana’s plans and whatever his desire</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I take him on my side and give him shelter, without ire.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama has given His promise of shelter to one and all who reach Him</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">More: to one who offers no opposition, He pours His grace to the brim</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">All one must understand is: the Lord awaits His child's submission</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He is then only too happy to show His mercy without repression:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">‘Sriman Narayana’ goes by many a different name</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Each represents a quality and reflects His eternal fame</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Once 'Parvati' asked 'Shiva': "Which of the Lord's names is best?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Which name is equal to His thousand names—uttering which name one is blest?"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Shiva replied: "Srirama's name that appeals to every fortunate heart</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Is practically equal to the 'Sahasranama': this fact you cannot distort</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">By chanting with devotion the thousand names of the Lord</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">One returns to Vaikunta, easily breaking his material cord.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When Rama returned to Vaikunta, He took every creature back</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">From the meanest grass and ant to the largest animals and humans, He did pack.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Anyone wanting eternal freedom from the birth-death cycle</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Must chant 'Srirama, Rama, Rama', which is the material bonds' sickle</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Because Rama's name yields the same result as the Sahasranama chanting</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Shiva, that epitome of wisdom, declared as supreme Rama's name, enchanting.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama now turned to Sugriva and said gently: “My friend, worry not.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Towards me, none can dare hold a harmful thought</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Just the tip of my little finger is enough to demolish any band</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">For that, I do not need My bow or arm or My hand</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Go and bring Vibhishana to me right this moment</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And even if Ravana has come, get him too—have faith in my powers dormant.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“If Vibhishana is here, it means life for a handful of ogres</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But if Ravana has come, peace for entire communities, it augurs.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama specially sent Sugriva to fetch Vibhishana to His presence:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He believed in building trust and wiping away resistance</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Not just that, when one approaches the Lord with a devotee at the head</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He feels more ready to grant sanctum without question and moves ahead</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sugriva went at once and brought Vibhishana for Rama's audience</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Gladly came forward that rakshasa, untainted by nescience.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He prostrated at Rama’s feet, while from his eyes tears flowed freely</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama lifted his pure-souled devotee and hugged him compassionately</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He said: “In Guha and Sugriva, I gained two brothers honourable</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With you, we have become seven sons to my father Dasaratha, venerable.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Omniscient One then declared, “I make you King of Lanka, rest assured.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana replied, “I came here seeking only thy feet: the feet Sugriva secured.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama beckoned to Lakshmana and asked him to fetch water from the ocean</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He coronated Vibhishana then and there, without further commotion</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama then proclaimed, “Ravana with his wicked clan shall perish</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I shall eliminate, from the horizon of ‘<i>Dharma</i>,’ that blemish.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Shurpanaka sought the Lord without His consort</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Consequently, her nose and ears, she lost</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana hankered for Sri sans Her Lord</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He lost his life for this thought, haphazard</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana came to the Lord having venerated Sri before:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He received the crown of ‘<i>Rama Samrajya</i>’, therefore</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Presently, Rama and His associates deliberated about reaching Lanka’s door:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“What would be the best mode to cross to the ocean’s other shore?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> Vibhishana spoke up softly and respectfully when thus addressed:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“For three days, you must pray to the Ocean God, undeterred.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana suggested ‘<i>Sharanagati,</i>’ because for him it had worked</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In his mind, the question “Would it work for the Lord of lords?” never lurked.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama lay meditating on the bare ground, His lotus face turned East</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With His snake-like arms curled up as a pillow, he resembled a resting beast</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In the meanwhile, Ravana sent to Sugriva, Shuka, his emissary</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana’s offer of friendship, that ogre conveyed in a manner wary</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A furious Sugriva, rejecting the offer with disgust, sent a fitting reply<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“I shall fight you from the side of Rama, with whom none in any world can vie.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama continued His prayer to the divine being of the oceans</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Desiring a passage to Lanka, he lay controlling His emotions</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">However, even after three days and nights, the ocean deity refused to appear</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama, black with anger, struck a pose that inspired awful fear</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He commanded Lakshmana to bring ‘Sarnga’, His divine bow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana complied, but got the weapon without any arrow.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama twanged His bow and exclaimed: “Lakshmana, I need an arrow!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana went slowly and brought an insignificant specimen, narrow.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama said: “For defeating the powerful ocean how will such an arrow do?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Get me a bigger one, dear brother, what is with you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A reluctant Lakshmana brought an arrow slightly better than the previous one:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It still wasn’t what Rama had in mind and so He chided: “What have you done?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Why was Lakshmana behaving in this strange manner?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Wasn’t He the ‘avatar’ of the thousand-hooded snake, impossible to shatter?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In usual practice, Rama had only to turn and look at Him:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When Lakshmana would jump up and ask: “Should I kill? Is that Your whim?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, this occasion was different: the ocean was Lakshmana’s kin</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He too was the Lord’s bed and thus to ‘Adisesha’ was akin.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Both Lakshmana and the Ocean were the Lord’s workers</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">One wanted to save the other, showing solidarity amongst servitors</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Finally, Lakshmana fetched an arrow suitable</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When Rama took aim, the ocean god appeared, his fright palpable.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Humbly joining his palms, that divine being supplicated</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“O Rama, pardon me,” he cried, scared of being mutilated.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The moment the Ocean bowed, Rama's pique evaporated<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He said: "Do not be afraid. With My arrow, your enemies shall be frustrated."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama is ready to modify His decision when His opponent capitulates:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Supreme alone shows the nobility such ready forgiving stipulates</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The ocean god then pointed to a place where perpetrators of evil lived</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama's sure arrow found its mark and the skulking wickedness it killed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">‘Sagara,’ the ocean God, said: "Your ancestors did me a good turn.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">By serving You, my gratitude I must return</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I shall have my waters calm: let the monkeys build a bridge<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">By directing them, ‘Nala’ and ‘Nila’ can, the time for completion abridge</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Let the monkeys write Your glorious name on rocks</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I shall keep them all afloat like so many wooden blocks."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sugriva now commanded the engineer monkeys ‘Nala-Nila’ to begin<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Every monkey and bear, happy to play a part in Sitarama's service, pitched in</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Breaking down mountains and carrying large boulders<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They resembled hills carrying hills on their shoulders</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The monkeys and bears wanted to complete the bridge quickly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Well before His next mealtime, Rama must reach Lanka” they thought lovingly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A large group of squirrels now joined this labouring throng</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Wanting to serve Rama physically, they had come along</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The squirrels declared: “O monkeys, about building a bridge you have no notion.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Not gluing the rocks together, you will soon set them in motion.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Saying thus, they went and immersed their furry forms in the ocean’s water</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Then, gathering sand on their bodies to shake between the rocks, they did totter<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The squirrels proclaimed: “We, who do the plastering, are the supervisors</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You must listen to our directions: we are entitled to be advisors.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Chaffing and motivating one another thus, those fortunate creatures toiled</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">While Rama, the universal parent, looked on with delight unspoiled</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The long bridge was completed in a matter of five days<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama’s army got ready to cross over to Lanka without further delays</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Shuka and a spy Sharana meanwhile delineated Rama’s indestructible might</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They also carried versions of the simians’ infinite prowess and will to fight</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After updating Ravana, they advised him to give up the idea of battle</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Even now Rama will forgive you—He is made of tolerant mettle.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, Ravana’s mind refused to accept that Rama was the Supreme incarnate:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Who can stop a moth that goes into fire to meet its wretched fate?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Next, Ravana sent another spy to find the status of Rama’s progress</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He reported they had walked on a bridge, making into Lanka a quick ingress</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana, daunted, gathered information about Rama’s troops</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He felt agitated on learning about the hordes of monkeys arrayed in groups<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As usual, Ravana decided to stoop to deception and trickery</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He approached an expert conjurer on his side, steeped in treachery</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana instructed the demon-magician to conjure a head:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“It must resemble Rama’s and produce in Sita horror and dread</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Also, make a large bow and arrows just like the ones Rama owns</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They must be realistic and must freeze Sita’s bones.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The magician quickly did as he was asked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana, seeking Sita’s submission, into Asoka grove passed</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Rama was killed in battle; His associates were conquered.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You had better fulfil my desire, because your only hope is shattered.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I have brought the slain Rama’s bloody head and His bow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Also look at His arrows, which for evidence I proceed to show.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana stood in front of Sita and displayed Rama’s head</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Poor Sita swooned seeing the severed head of the Lord she had wed</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When She regained consciousness, Sita began lamenting piteously</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Considering Kaushalya’s predicament and her own fate, she cried repeatedly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Then Sita begged Ravana thus: “You killed my only support, now kill me too.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I want to join my husband in the upper realms to where He flew.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Just then an emissary came to Ravana in a hurry</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On getting his message that Rakshasa plunged into worry.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana left quickly, and Sita continued her tearful mourning undiminished</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, as soon as Ravana went, Rama’s head and bow too vanished</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita, taken aback, began to wonder about the genuineness of what she had seen</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Just then, a kind ogress, and an attendant, began reassuring Rama’s queen</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Rama is arrived at Lanka with His brother and an army, powerful and sprawling</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana resorted to mean duplicity, because this battle he is scared of losing.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Rest assured, Rama is well; the good portents around you, please observe.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Your husband will destroy Ravana and rescue you: believe this without reserve.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">At that instant, Sita saw and felt many auspicious omens</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She realised Rama was unharmed and would defeat the demons</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Offering prayers for her husband’s well-being and victory</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita sat down composed and began her wait for liberty</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The sounds of kettledrums and conches from Rama’s army induced panic</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana’s bosom began to tremble and his angry passions became volcanic</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The king of Lanka called his council of ministers to chart further action</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Malyavan, his maternal grandfather, advised: “Seek peace and evade desolation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I see the most hideous omens for our tribe; total destruction they portend</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Make truce with Rama by restoring His wife to Him and your iniquity, amend.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana ignored the old ogre’s words and began to draw his plan</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He stationed powerful army heads at Lanka’s gates to safeguard his clan<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana sent his companions as spies to learn the enemy’s arrangements</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They came back with information about Ravana’s defence placements</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama sent monkey chiefs like Angada and Hanuman to storm Lanka’s gates</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He decided to remain on Mt. Suvela debating tactics with other associates</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Soon, Rama, Lakshmana, Vibhishana and Sugriva reached the mountain's crest</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With a view to understanding Lanka’s layout before taking a rest</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They spotted Ravana’s magnificent mansion with its numerous pillars</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And also many towers, waterways, buildings and gardens filled with colours</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sugriva then saw the ten-headed Ravana surveying the scene from a tall tower<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In red-eyed anger, he leapt close to the demon and startled him with his power<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sugriva proceeded to snatch Ravana’s crown and dashed it to the ground</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Then he and Ravana, wrestling one another, began to go round and round</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After many difficult maneuvers and hard punching, the two became tired</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana contemplated resorting to magic, when Sugriva quickly retired</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The vexed and astonished demon looked thoroughly baffled</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And the satisfied Sugriva returned to his camp unruffled</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The monkey army were highly delighted by Sugriva's courage</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They honoured him by going on a typical ape-like rampage</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But a worried Rama hugging Sugriva cried, “How could you take such a chance?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Promise me you will do nothing foolhardy: you must at once take that stance.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">What would be the point of Sita’s release</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">were I to lose you? My dear friend, then my life too would cease!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After being duly pacified, Rama ordered Lakshmana: “Let our army remain alert.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Divide them into battle arrays so that any sudden charge we can readily avert.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The unruly winds, glowering clouds, and the trembling earth forebode calamity</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Many intrepid warriors from both sides will die, I can say with certainty."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Soon, Rama, who trod virtue’s path, climbed down from the mountain peak</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And at the appropriate moment, He marched forth with His army, havoc to wreak.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Upon reaching the gates of Lanka, Rama decided to send one last message of peace</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He called Angada and said: “Tell Ravana his atrocities he must cease.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If he is willing to return Sita unharmed, we will return without a battle</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Else, there would destruction that the three worlds would rattle.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Carrying Rama’s message to Ravana, Angada boldly made his voice heard</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Seize and crush that arrogant monkey,” a furious Ravana ordered</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, Tara and Vali’s son escaped to the palace roof with a powerful leap</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He cried mockingly: “Ravana, in the battle, the fruits of your sins, you shall reap.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Then that valiant young ape crushed the top of Ravana’s mansion into tiny bits</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana felt fear gripping his mind and his quivering heart going into fits.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The demons seeing the ocean of monkeys at their gates became fretful</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Their king too was uneasy at Rama’s unfailing progress and felt far from restful</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Angada returned to Rama and conveyed Ravana’s refusal</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama realised the demons would not escape their punishment brutal</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He commanded His monkey troops to commence fighting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The monkeys blew conches and beat drums to announce their coming</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They broke Lanka’s trees and mountaintops to use as weapons</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Their nails and teeth too became tools to teach battle lessons</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Many of the monkey chiefs fought ferocious demons</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">For their armies, their brave deeds became motivating beacons</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Angada fought Indrajit, and Lakshmana held Virupaksha<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">While Rama’s relentless arrows struck ‘<i>rakshasa</i>’ after ‘<i>rakshasa</i>’</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Jambhavan, Sugriva, and Hanuman planted terror among the enemy lines</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Fierce fighting continued, and the intrepid warriors knew no confines</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The demons became more active and rejuvenated after sundown:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Though the battle carried on, Rama’s army fought without breaking down</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama hunted tirelessly, and Lakshmana proved his immeasurable prowess<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Angada destroyed Indrajit’s chariot and charioteer and put that ogre in duress</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Indrajit vanished from the battlefield abruptly much to the monkeys’ delight</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But returned invisible and bored Ayodhya’s princes with toxic arrows of might</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama and Lakshmana, struck by the serpentine arrows lay immobilised</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The monkeys turned helpless and despondent and stood paralysed</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The invisible Indrajit attacked several other monkey chiefs:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He was no stranger to stealth and underhanded mischiefs</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Upon seeing his friend Rama and his key army personnel fallen</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sugriva was shocked and sat down in a corner crestfallen</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana looked closely at Rama and grasped the real situation</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“O Sugriva, do not grieve. Ask our army not to give way to lamentation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama’s face shows strong signs of life and very soon He will wake</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The venom from Indrajit’s arrows has to dissipate—some time it will take.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hearing Vibhishana’s reassurances, Sugriva gained confidence</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He consoled his folks: “Rama will soon rise and show His competence.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Indrajit became overjoyed seeing Rama and Lakshmana lying prostrate</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He assumed they were lifeless and began to celebrate</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rushing to his father’s mansions, he poured forth the day’s events</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He said: “Your enemies are no more, father; forget your torments.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana extolled the valour of his son to the skies</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He cried: “Singlehanded, you have exceeded all my other allies.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana then summoned the demonesses guarding Rama’s wife</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He said: “Take Sita in my aerial chariot and let her see Rama devoid of life.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The ogresses took Sita in the ‘<i>Pushpaka Vimana’</i> to the battlefield</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita saw with her own eyes Rama and Lakshmana on arrow beds, congealed</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The shocked princess burst into uncontrollable sobs and wondered aloud:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“My father’s expert astrologers predicted I should never be widowed!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“How come their words have proven empty today?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">For the death-god my dear husband has become prey.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I saw so many auspicious signals that gave me full hope</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They have all turned out false: with this sorrow, I cannot cope.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hearing Sita crying bitterly, a kindly demoness ‘Trijata’, consoled her</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She said: “Your husband and brother-in-law are alive: this I do infer.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Trijata continued: “This sacred chariot never hovers over death.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Moreover, of hope on the monkeys’ faces, there is no dearth.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Also, I perceive many omens that predict good things for you</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Those very same signs bring Lanka’s desolation into my view.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hearing the arguments of Trijata, Sita was persuaded</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And by the time she was taken back to the Asoka grove, her fears faded</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Soon, Rama woke from His swoon and found Lakshmana lying still</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Agonised, He began wailing aloud and to fight further, He lost the will</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That heroic Raghava then told Sugriva: "Without Lakshmana, I shall die</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You must leave with your army and escape the ‘<i>rakshasas</i>’ sly."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On hearing Rama's words, the monkeys shed tears copious</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They could not bear to see Rama and Lakshmana in situations grievous.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Vibhishana established order in the monkey troops</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He then approached Rama, who resembled a flower that droops</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That rakshasa proclaimed, "Victory be to Rama" and clove through the crowd</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Upon seeing Rama and Lakshmana, he cried, "Alas, fallen are the princes proud!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They look like porcupines with the pierced arrows shining</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">My brother's son with a perverse soul has brought them down by cunning."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sushena, the monkey with knowledge of medicinal herbs suggested:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"By infusing the juice of celestial plants, life can be injected."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Just then Garuda, the powerful eagle and vehicle of the Supreme arrived</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Upon perceiving him, utmost terror the snakes in the area derived</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The snake venom that had tied Rama and Lakshmana got neutralised</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And the brothers woke as though from a rest, well utilised.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana and all the monkeys rent the air with their joyous sounds</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The fear Ravana and his cronies felt at this tumult knew no bounds</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The monkeys romped into Ravana’s city again with uprooted trees and rocks</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Desirous of fighting the covert demons, they stormed the place in large flocks</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The king of Lanka sent his powerful leaders one by one into the fray</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, the monkeys and bears expelled or killed them all without delay</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Dhumraksha and Vajradamstra were two reliable ogres Ravana chose</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They too died in battle along with their respective armies assembled in rows</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Next, Hanuman held Akhampana in combat and had him exterminated<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The powerful Prahasta’s life with his soldiers’, Nila then terminated</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Shaken by his many losses, Ravana himself ventured into the warfare</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Along with Indrajit, Atikaya, Kumbha, Nikhumba and others, amidst fanfare</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama and his side were more than equal to Ravana and his supporters</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The rakshasas had a tough fight once again and retired hurt to their quarters</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama held the bragging Ravana in combat and of His arrows gave him a taste</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The king of Lanka struggled under Rama’s onslaught and was soon laid to waste</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To the hurt and swooning Ravana, the magnanimous Rama spoke:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“I do not fight a foe who stands weaponless and broke.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Return to your palace and come again tomorrow</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Once more I shall give you battle and show you many an arrow.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana, back in his apartments, was steeped in deep worry</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He gave commands to wake his giant brother Kumbhakarna in a hurry</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Kumbhakarna, had a boon to sleep unhindered, to wake for a day after every half-year</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He now slumbered in his palace and resembled a colossus of muscle sheer</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Kumbhakarna woke up after being roused by several demons</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He realised his brother was in trouble and hurried to answer his summons</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When Kumbhakarna learnt about Sita’s abduction, he became furious</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He rebuked Ravana for his disregard of Vibhishana’s advice glorious</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana begged: “What has transpired I cannot undo.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">At this point in time, I need help, which only you can do.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Kumbhakarna agreed to help Ravana by going into the war field</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“By destroying all your enemies, our nation from calamity I shall shield.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Making that promise, Kumbhakarna rushed out into the conflict</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, he sensed many bad omens and understood his clan would soon be derelict</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">However, ignoring the portents, Kumbhakarna trampled everything in his path</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He left a trail of destruction, mutilation, death, and blood bath</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The monkey soldiers frightened out of their wits fled</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Angada buoyed them up and soon their perturbation they shed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Dvivida, Hanuman, Angada and Sugriva engaged Kumbakarna in turn</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, in that ‘<i>rakhsasa</i>’, even the smallest sign of defeat they could not discern</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Soon, Kumbhakarna proceeded towards Rama with a mountain peak</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, Rama blew it into bits with His arrows that resembled lightning streaks</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama then decided to end Kumbhakarna’s menace</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And began releasing arrows with a quickened pace</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He slew Kumbhakarna by slashing off his limbs and head with His deadly darts</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That fearsome ogre lay on Lanka’s earth, in a pool of blood and body parts</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana heard of his brother’s death and fainted with shock</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Coming to, he wailed, “I lost my brother whose loyalty was a rock.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana then sadly contemplated his actions that were buried in sin</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He thought: “I should have heeded Vibhishana, the sagacious among all my kin.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The king of Lanka now realised Rama’s super-human powers</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Rama is the divine being, who the sinful to dust lowers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I am certain to lose this war, which I waged out of arrogant lust</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Alas, I have sacrificed so many! Perish, I too must.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After lamenting a while, Ravana planned for the war to continue<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“We shall fight for you,” said his sons, part of his most accomplished retinue</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Trishira, Devantaka, Narantaka, and Atikaya went on an offensive</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, they too were felled by various monkey chiefs, after fights extensive</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana and his wives were left to cry over their sons’ bodies</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The king of Lanka and his supporters reaped the fruits of depraved follies</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Indrajit saw his parents mourning his brothers</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He vowed: “I shall annihilate Rama by unleashing wonders.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That capable son of Ravana entered the battle again and there performed a ritual<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The rite made him indomitable and gave him greater powers than usual</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Becoming invisible once more, Indrajit flew into the sky</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He began to shower weapons like torrential rain from high</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama and Lakshmana fell unconscious, along with several of the monkey troops</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lord Brahma’s missile wrought destruction and struck the soldier groups</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Jambhavan instructed Hanuman to fly over to the Himalayas and bring herbs:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">‘Mrita Sanjivani, Vishalya Karani, Suvarna Karani and Sandhani’, valuable shrubs</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hanuman flew across the ocean and went North to reach the Himalayan range</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Failing to identify the herbs among others, his plan he proceeded to change.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“I must uproot and carry back the mountain, which Jambhavan had described</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Let the wise bear pick out the medicinal herbs, as he prescribed.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Thus, Hanuman flew back with the mountain slice to the battleground</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With the celestial herbs, Rama and His entire army came around</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama, Sugriva and Jambhavan then praised Hanuman, the lifesaver</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“There is none to equal you: from your duty, you never waver.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The battle resumed again in right earnest and Ravana’s kith entered the fray</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sugriva and Hanuman killed brothers Kumbha and Nikhumba on the same day</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Enraged by his setbacks, Ravana ordered Makaraksha, Khara’s son to fight</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Kill Rama and Lakshmana and destroy the monkeys: I thirst for the sight.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, Makaraksha too was despatched to the higher regions by Rama’s missile</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Good triumphs over evil: trying to change this law of nature is futile</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Indrajit made a plan: “Let me conjure Sita’s form and slit her throat</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Upon learning about it, Rama will be stupefied and cannot stay afloat.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That sly ‘<i>rakshasa</i>’ came upon Hanuman fighting a large demon troop</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hovering and pulling his sword, he killed Sita’s conjured form with a single swoop</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A shocked Hanuman ran back to Rama and reported the horrifying circumstance</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama, uttering an anguished cry, fainted away and fell to earth in a trance</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana dashed to his brother and placed His head on his lap</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Oh brother, open Your eyes—out of this misery, You must snap.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I shall avenge Sita; and all Your adversaries, I vow to crush</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Remember Your duties as a warrior and to the battle, rush.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana came upon Rama and Lakshmana in tears</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He said: “O Rama, it is just Indrajit’s trick; wipe away Your fears.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama now opened His eyes and listened to Vibhishana’s explanation in detail<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He realised His Sita lived still—He had no reason to wail</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana then urged Rama to send Lakshmana to fight Indrajit:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“To prevent Indrajit’s sacrifice and exterminate him, Your brother is fit.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The wicked one is in the Nikhumbila cave performing a fire ritual</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If he completes it and earns its fruits, no army can be effectual.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana rushed to the said cave and challenged Indrajit to combat</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He rained arrows upon him and cried, “Today, I vow to flatten you like a gnat.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Indrajit, forced to abandon his ritual, came out to fight<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“You gave my secret away, vile uncle,” he shouted with spite</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana and Indrajit then entered into a ferocious mutual attack</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Eventually, Lakshmana chopped Indrajit’s head, leaving no room for a comeback</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana returned to Rama victorious, but covered in gashes</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sushena treated his wounds with herbs and prepared him for further clashes</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana’s distress knew no end upon learning of Indrajit’s death</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The demonesses’ wailing and grief further took away his breath</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The king of Lanka cried: “Let me destroy Sita who is the reason for my ruination.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, Suparshva, Ravana’s upright minister, prevented him from that errant action.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama meanwhile, continued fighting the demon forces</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana entered the battle arena again to harvest further consequences<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Along with Ravana fought many of his ministers and aides</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But none could survive against the monkey and bear brigades</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sugriva eliminated Virupaksha and Mahodara, while Mahaparsva, Angada killed</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And at the intensity of the Rama-Ravana combat, the world thrilled</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On his shoulders, Hanuman carried Rama as He fought</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Thus, Rama could strike Ravana sitting on a high perch as he ought</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana saw Rama striking him with a calm determination</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He schemed to hurt Hanuman and destroy Rama’s concentration</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In general, Rama kept His anger under total control</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He could command His anger as He pleased, being a tolerant soul</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">So long as the demon was hitting Him, Rama never faltered</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, the moment Ravana struck Hanuman grievously, He was altered</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Now, indignation had Rama under its thumb and directed Him:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama went and came, as per its commands, grim.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Lord habitually overlooks any number of personal insults and bother<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, pardon for the troubles caused to His devotee, He refuses to offer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Presently, Ravana spotted Lakshmana and threw a spear at his bosom</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The spear penetrated Lakshmana’s heart and he dropped like a plucked blossom</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama, incensed, began raining fiery arrows in torrents</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana ran for cover to escape their deadly currents</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama then knelt next His brother and once more felt wracked by despondency</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, Sushena told Rama, “Let not Your mind waver from its constancy.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Hanuman must once more fetch divine herbs from the Himalayan peak</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It will heal Lakshmana and make him sit up and speak.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Maruti then rushed to Mt. Mahodaya and searched for the plant</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Failing to spot it, he knocked and carried back its peak, as though it were an ant</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana was cured soon and returned to the concluding war</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana too came back to fight—and to meet his end, which was not afar.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Indra, the chief of the gods of heaven, sent his chariot for Rama to ride</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He also sent a spear, some arrows and his charioteer Maatali as guide</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The fierce battle between Rama and Ravana resumed</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">By Rama’s constant stream of sharp arrows, Ravana was consumed</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When the demon’s charioteer saw Ravana tottering feebly,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He guided the chariot away from the warfare ably</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Upon gaining his senses, Ravana asked to re-enter the battle:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That demon king, famed for bravery and resilience, nothing could rattle</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In the meanwhile, Sage Agastya arrived there to give Rama advice</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He said: “Chant the ‘<i>Aditya Hridaya</i>’ and get energy from the Sun god in a trice.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama did as bid and showered Ravana with His unflinching arrows</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The darts slashed the heads of that ogre, who took birth to bestow sorrows</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, Ravana’s heads grew back as soon as they were cut</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama’s efforts were not fructifying, though He rampaged like an elephant in rut</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Maatali now spoke: “Aim the missile presided by Brahma at Ravana’s heart.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He will give up his life then, that being his vulnerable part.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama focused His mind and released the powerful missile like a gale</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It found its mark and Ravana finally fell to earth, turning pale.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The gods and sages who had come to watch the momentous action</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hailed Rama and showered fragrant flowers without cessation</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama asked Hanuman to meet Sita and convey the news of His victory <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The monkey ran to Janaki’s presence and said, “Upon Rama be glory.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He killed Ravana after a spirited fight and won the war</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Your troubles are over now and You may rejoice, O lady without par.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita shed incessant tears and said not a word</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hanuman asked: “With tears, why are your eyes blurred?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Have I done any wrong? Why are you so silent?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">At this propitious news, I expected you to become vibrant!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita swallowed hard and conveyed her thanks by bringing her palms together</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She said: “For all the help you have rendered child, I am grateful forever.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“I am unable to utter freely, because my heart is choked with relief</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I am yearning to meet my husband and dispel all my grief.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In this place, away from my home, I cannot gift you any object</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Do ask something of me: I wish to show you my respect.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hanuman replied: “No need to thank your child and humble servant</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Just let me crush the demonesses who tormented You: that’s my wish fervent.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita now chided Hanuman for his desire degrading and hasty</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She said: “It is Ravana who commanded the demonesses to be nasty</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When Vibhishana tells them to decorate me, they will do that too</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They merely obey orders, and you must show mercy to them as their due.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Who isn’t a sinner in this world? You, Rama, and I too are sinners.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Your sin is, wanting to kill those who sought your pardon like beggars.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama, when He wed me, took a vow to never leave my side</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, He did, and for the last ten months, I was here and nearly died</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You ask what my sin is? In your hearing, I criticise my husband’s actions<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A wife must never speak to an outsider about her dissatisfactions!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If your master, Rama, were to give deliverance only to those without sin</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To take with Him to His abode, Vaikunta, none can He win!"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">From Sita's sharp response, Hanuman understood the depth of Her forbearance</span><span class="s2">:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He realised that Her lotus feet perpetually generated benevolence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Once again Sita proved that She was infinitely superior to Her consort</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">While He protects only His devotees, She is everyone’s impartial resort</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">‘One Sita equals a thousand Rama’ is no exaggeration<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She is patience personified, beyond even the Lord's comprehension!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Mandodari, hearing of Ravana’s death, rushed to the battlefield</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“O valiant husband, how much power and fame you did wield?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Even the gods were afraid of going against your wishes</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Yet you lie here on bare earth having given up all your riches.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Oh, why did you fail to see Vishnu Himself in Rama’s form?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Why did you covet Sita, the pinnacle of virtues, against every norm?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita, the epitome of chaste conduct has the tolerance of Mother earth</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And combines the benevolent charm of Lakshmi, the Lord’s consort, in Her birth</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She is immersed in Her husband’s thoughts all the time</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She has no use for riches, tainted with sins’ grime</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When you dared interfere with her, you sealed your fate</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Your atrocities that brought this desolation, none can vindicate.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Earlier, Rama killed your brother Khara along with thousands of demon folk</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He revealed He was no mere mortal by that single stroke</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Next, Hanuman came here and destroyed our entire kingdom by setting fire</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And mere monkeys built a bridge over the ocean and entered our sphere</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Did you not realise Rama is the eternal soul, with neither beginning nor end—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The presiding soul of the universe, whom nothing or none can bend?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama is the one beyond ignorance; He is Creation’s nourishment</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He came to earth for evil’s destruction and Dharma’s establishment</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He is the wielder of the Conch, Disc, and Mace</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He carries the ‘Srivatsa’ mark on His chest with grace</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He is the truly mighty One and is unconquerable</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As the Lord of all the worlds, He keeps everything stable</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">O Ravana, my husband, by lust your senses were soiled</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Your ignominious ambitions, Rama, the just Lord of all worlds, has foiled."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Mourning thus, Mandodari wept over her husband's slain body</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Though she acknowledged, while alive, evil he did embody.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Now, Rama instructed Vibhishana to perform Ravana's final rite:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Cremate your brother with respect and do what is right."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, Vibhishana refused to do the rituals in Ravana's funeral</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama advised: "Enmity and hate cease at the end of the carnal."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">What He meant was: the hatred in Ravana’s heart had ended</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama Himself never harbours hatred, because in Him every soul is blended</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"If you will not perform the last rites for your brother, let me do it</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">For many—like Kabandha, Jatayu, and Viradha—funeral pyres I have lit."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hearing Rama's admonition, Vibhishana concluded the solemnities</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">At Rama's behest, Lakshmana crowned Vibhishana, amidst festivities<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana then approached Sita reverently and said: "Rama awaits you.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Please decorate yourself and appear before your husband true."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita replied: "I would like to show Rama my dusty, emaciated state."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, Vibhishana said: "Rama's wish that you be decked, let us not debate."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita was soon clad in splendour and carried out in a palanquin<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As she neared Rama, the monkeys jostled one another to see Rama's queen</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama, seeing Hanuman pushing the monkeys away, felt irritated<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Let Sita walk and let my devotees see her without being frustrated."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita got out of her carriage at once and walked up to Rama slowly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Relief and joy made the dainty lady feel weak and shaky</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama perceived Sita dressed in glorious robes and jewellery<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Why are you dressed in this grand manner, O Sita?" He asked sternly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita, perturbed by Rama's tone said, "Vibhishana conveyed it as Your wish!"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama retorted, "You failed to sense my words as mere etiquette: you are foolish.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">By defeating the demon that took you away, I salvaged my dynasty's honour</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, accepting you, who lived for long in a stranger's place, would be improper."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"As I look at you, my eyes feel a throbbing strain<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Like the sore eyes of a man, who looks at a light, hurt with pain.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I have done my duty in redeeming you from your offender</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You may now go where you please," said Rama to Sita, the one with a waist slender.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Though harsh, Rama placed blame on His own head: this fact His words indicate</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After all, the problem is not the light; it is the man in the sore-eyed state.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Everyone present there felt appalled and distressed at Rama's attitude</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They wondered, "How will the blameless Sita bear this with fortitude?"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Shocked into silence, Sita shed helpless tears of humiliation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Turning to Lakshmana, she said, "Light me a fire" in indignation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita then spoke quietly to Rama, "O husband, you have insulted me.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When I enter the fire, from Your deplorable doubts, You shall be free."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Just then the Gods of heaven appeared and addressed Rama thus:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"You know well that Sita was abducted by force and was helpless</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Fully aware of her divine birth and qualities, how could you be so severe?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Why do You stand by without preventing Sita from entering the pyre?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Recollect Your own divinity and the purpose of Your birth:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You and Sita are Narayana and Lakshmi, who pour mercy without dearth."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That faultless Sita now proceeded to pray to the God of Fire:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Prove my chastity by keeping my body intact—my need now is dire."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She then jumped into the flames lit obediently by Lakshmana<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, the fire God brought her out and handed her to Rama</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He said: "Sita is chastity. Your stance is unworthy and unjust.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She is ever faithful to You in thought, word and deed: You know it best!"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama acknowledged the gods' words and the fire god's statement</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He accepted Sita with great delight and contentment</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama then said: "Sita to me is like sunlight to sun</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, taking her without examining, I, as a King, could not have done.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I know Sita could have destroyed Ravana by mere dint of her virtue</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The world too now knows her stature: and Sita, no blame can pursue."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lord Shiva then said to Rama: "O Supreme, seek blessings from Your father.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Look, there he stands with Indra awaiting You, Sita and Your brother."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama declared: "I prefer to be addressed not as the Supreme, but as Dasaratha's son.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Then, prostrating to His father, He said: “Mother Kaikeyi and Bharatha, you must not shun."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Dasaratha, well satisfied, acceded to Rama's request and said:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Sita and Lakshmana! Serve Rama: that's the path you must always tread."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The gods then thanked Rama for completing their mission</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Indra said: "O peerless one, ask of us a boon that You envision"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama asked, “Let all the monkeys who died battling for me come alive.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Indra granted the desire and much pleasure did Rama derive</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Now the celestials asked Rama to return to Ayodhya and accept its kingship</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Proceed fast: Bharatha, separated from You, has endured enough hardship."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama took leave of Vibhishana, Sugriva, Hanuman and others</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Thank you all for fighting on my side like my brothers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">O Vibhishana, there's very little time for my exile to end</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I must reach Bharatha by then: my stay I cannot extend.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Is there any way to reach my kingdom quickly?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I await your suggestion anxiously."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana said: "You must travel in ‘<i>Pushpaka</i>’, Ravana's aerial car</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Let it be used for a good purpose now: for it, no distance is too far.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">All of us want to come with our families and watch Your coronation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Please take us along, this chariot can assume the required proportion."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">So, Rama and Sita, accompanied by all their loving devotees became air bound</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama showed Sita several spots and their significance, profound</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When the 'Pushpaka' reached Kishkinda, the monkeys hurriedly got down</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They climbed back in with their families, eager to see Rama's head in a crown</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama soon ordered the aerial car to land at Bharadwaja's hermitage</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He enquired about His family's welfare, after prostrating respectfully to the sage</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The hermit reassured Him and said, "I saw the events that transpired.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">By killing Ravana, You did all the good the righteous required."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama requested Bharadwaja to make the wild trees produce edible fruits</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The monkeys felt satiated feasting on those and other roots and shoots</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharadwaja now commanded Rama to stay the night at his hut</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Proceed tomorrow morning to Ayodhya; You must not leave me yet."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama objected and said: "O sage, you know very well my exile ends tonight</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If Bharatha fails to see me at dawn tomorrow, what would be his plight?"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The sage replied with a smile: "Send Hanuman ahead with Your message</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Let your messenger reassure Bharatha and his anxiety assuage."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama said: Hanuman, go to Ayodhya. Tell Bharatha I am at Bharadwaja's place</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I shall reach him early tomorrow; with this information, give him solace."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hanuman, folding his palms and carrying Rama's message, departed</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He flew into Ayodhya to calm Bharatha who was growing frustrated.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">At Nandigrama, Hanuman perceived Bharatha dressed like a hermit</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Shatrughna stood close by that devotion's summit</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Just then, the day began to dawn and Bharatha looked around sadly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He said, "My Rama has not come to wipe away our melancholy.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">O brother Shatrughna, Rama promised to be here the very next day after His exile</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Alas, He has not come for some reason, and my waiting has been futile."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I have vowed to shed my life if Rama failed to return<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Please light a fire: I shall jump in it and this body I shall burn.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">My eyes have thirsted for my beloved brother's sight for fourteen long years</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Yet without mercy for this slave and devotee, He allows me to wallow in tears."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Crying in this manner, that gentle brother of Rama made his decision, dire.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And the peerless Shatrughna lit for Bharatha a large pyre.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hanuman thought, "How do I stop Bharatha from taking this extreme step?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I must sing Rama's story just like I did for Sita: it will hold him like a web!"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That unparalleled monkey then started to chant Rama's name in a sweet voice</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He narrated incidents concerning Rama, at which Bharatha began to rejoice</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharatha and Shatrughna looked around and saw Hanuman appear</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They asked eagerly, "More about Rama, we would like to hear."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hanuman folded his palms with respect and said: "I am Rama's slave</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I have come here with Rama's message: for His sake, your life you must save.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama says: "I am at Bharadwaja's ashram now and will come to you in a short while</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Await my return, O Bharatha, my darling brother without guile."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hearing the words of Hanuman, that pious Bharatha felt overcome</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He embraced the divine monkey tightly, like he would his dearest chum.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharadwaja had a reason for asking Rama to stay a night</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He realised Bharatha’s life, sudden joy could shut out and blight</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hanuman became a cushion for Bharatha's intense elation</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And kept him sane and alive till Rama returned to tumultuous acclamation</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharatha and Shatrughna heard the events of the past</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And felt delighted by their brothers’ achievements vast.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">While Ayodhya joyously awaited Rama's arrival and impending coronation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That divine saviour descended into the kingdom amidst gaiety and celebration<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After embracing His brothers and prostrating to His mothers, Rama stood</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He resembled a mighty mountain surmounted by splendorous wood</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Kosala's citizens finally felt at peace with all the elements</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And busied themselves paying Rama and Sita plentiful compliments</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama and His brothers removed their matted hair and hermit's garb</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They were soon clad in outfits appropriate for the Royal orb</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita was taken to her chambers to change into suitable attire</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She too emerged presently, radiant as a bright fire</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama asked Lakshmana to be His Prince Regent</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But Lakshmana declined Rama's offer with a reason cogent</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I am already the King of the kingdom of Your servants</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">What do I care for Ayodhya's sovereignty with its material torments?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">There stands Bharatha, who carries out Your every command</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You must place in front of that exalted slave of Yours this demand."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama only had to look at Bharatha, before he nodded his assent</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Your wish is my command," said that brother, without dissent.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama with His brothers then climbed a chariot and was taken in a procession</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Nine thousand elephants followed, with Sugriva and other monkeys, in unison</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">At the conclusion of the procession, Vasishta led Rama and Sita to Ayodhya's throne<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">From their exalted seat made of precious gems, the divine couple shone.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vasishta bid the monkeys fetch holy waters from various rivers and oceans</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The subsequent scene of Rama’s and Sita's consecration exceeded all notions</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sage Vasishta, chanting holy mantras, crowned Rama's divine head</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">All beings on earth felt as though they had been crowned in Rama's stead:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama permeates all, and in Him reside all creation:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In that instant, every creature felt it without exception.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The trees became laden with fragrant flowers and a mild breeze blew</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Entire nature smiled in harmony and tranquil everything grew</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama gave away copious gold and jewels to Brahmans and other people</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He also gave presents to His friends who were loving and simple:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He presented Sugriva with a gem-studded garland<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And gave Angada an ornament for the arm, a glittering band</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama gifted to Sita a string of pearls from the wind God<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita desiring to give it to Hanuman, looked meaningfully at her Lord.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama smilingly gave His consent and a few steps Sita walked</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Going up to Hanuman and placing the necklace in his hands, she talked:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Dear Hanuman, You have done me a supreme favour and I am grateful</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">May your renown grow and May you remain Rama's foremost slave rightful.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To bless Hanuman, Sita, the goddess of fortune, got down from Her seat<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The glory the monkey acquired then, can anything ever beat?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To Vibhishana, Rama gifted the idol He worshipped at prayer</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">By this action, He again proved His magnanimous fervour</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">None would part with the deity he worships, easily</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, Lord Rama did that out of His love, unstintingly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana thankfully accepted and took the deity—Sri Ranganatha—along</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On the way, he put the idol down for rituals—but not for long.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After performing his prayers, that statue, Vibhishana tried to pack</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, the deity refused to budge and desired to stay back</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The location was between the river ‘Kaveri’s two branches</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Set in the southern part of India, Sri Rangam, whose glory is matchless</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vibhishana at once offered to remain back, worshipping the deity</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Lord sent him on to Lanka: but faces South to this day, blessing Vibhishana’s piety.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Under Rama's rule, the world enjoyed peace and bounty</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">For every being, it was 'Rama, Rama, Rama' in plenty</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama ruled the kingdom thus for eleven thousand years<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">During '<i>Rama Rajya</i>' all beings were spiritually exalted and lived without fears</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Anyone who listens to, reads, tells or writes Rama's divine story</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In this world and the next, will obtain the highest glory.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
