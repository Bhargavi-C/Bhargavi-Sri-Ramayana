<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Prelude:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Dasaratha, the sinless emperor of Kosala, begets sons—</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama, Lakshmana, Bharatha and Shatrughna from the heavens</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The foursome grow up into strong, valorous and virtuous youth</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama and Lakshmana fight their maiden battles to uphold Vedic truth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The four brothers are married to Janaka’s daughters, comely</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama destroys Parasurama’s pride by stringing his Bow of Vishnu firmly.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Story in Detail:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For sixty thousand years ruled Dasaratha,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The kingdom of Kosala, with his capital at Ayodhya.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The mighty ruler had fought many a war and oft,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But the citizens knew nothing but his heart soft.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Even the heavenly denizens counted on his support;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He fought their demonic enemies as though it were a sport.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kosala was a kingdom blessed with bounty and happiness<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ayodhya was the city from where happened its business</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Dasaratha considered himself only a caretaker of the kingdom</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Accordingly his rule and every decree was backed by solid wisdom</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The people had no needs: they were all fulfilled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With neither theft nor beggary, their lives were goodness-filled</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The King had but one burning worry</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With no heir to protect his people, he felt sorry</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Dasaratha's three chief queens—Kaushalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitra too</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Wallowed and suffered for want of sons true.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Enquired the King of sage Vasishta, his preceptor,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A way to beget a son—a benevolent benefactor.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The sage realised the time was ripe—</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The righteous' tears the Almighty must descend and wipe.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">After much musing and careful consideration,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Suggested Vasishta with commiseration:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"Request sage 'Rshyashringa' to perform a 'Puthra Kameshti Yaga,'</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For the world is ready to see the dawn of a new saga."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Dasaratha invited, with great humility and respect,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The sage with a bright and pleasing aspect.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rshyashringa conducted the ceremony with reverence<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And it yielded the desired fruit in consequence</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A divine form appeared from the Yaga Fire,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With a vessel of sweet porridge, not easy to acquire.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"Give this to your three queens" said the heavenly being</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And Dasaratha took it with a devout and joyous bearing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A half to Kaushalya and a quarter to Sumitra he presented</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One half of a quarter to Kaikeyi he granted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Left with the last one-eighth of the potion,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The King thought hard over the ambrosial portion.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The first half, Kaushalya swallowed, wishing for the heir,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Hoping for the Prince regent, Kaikeyi quickly had her share.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sumitra, the ever wise and philosophical woman,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calmly waited, wanting sons uncommon.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Dasaratha after due deliberation handed the remaining part<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To Sumitra, the queen after his heart.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sumitra consumed the two parts given her,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Praying to the divine, two sons to confer.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Her first share would give a servitor par excellence<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To serve the eldest, the Lord Supreme, in every sense.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The ambrosial share would bestow a special son,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To serve the second, the Lord's devotee, with extreme devotion.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The heavenly denizens had prayed for divine intervention</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As the wicked were torturing the virtuous without cessation.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The ever-merciful Lord Narayana to their request assented</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And promised evil would be destroyed and good protected.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Earth had become heavy with the foes of piety</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And to save it came down that original and foremost deity.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ravana, the demon chief, through the severest penance</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Had propitiated Lord Brahma and earned his benevolent glance</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">No one could destroy him, except man and monkey:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For his ultimate death, these exceptions proved the key</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Lord therefore decided to come down as man<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While the 'devas' to assist Him appeared in the monkey clan.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A remarkable statue of Sriman Narayana was with the Ikshvaku race</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The kings in its lineage offered it prayers with devotion and grace</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Almighty however was not quite satisfied—</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Even with thousands of years of worship, he was not gratified</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So He chose the Ikshvaku clan for taking birth</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To venerate Himself, to the possible extent of His worth!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Twelve months after the Puthra Kameshti, four sons were born,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Effulgent they looked, like the sun at dawn.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the pleasant month of Chaithra, under the Punarvasu star on the ninth day</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Came the first son, with eyes as cool and refreshing as the full moon's ray</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">On the next day, a son was born to Kaikeyi under the Pushya star,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While under the Ashlesha star, to Sumitra came twin sons without par.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">After eleven days was fixed the time for the naming ceremony</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The queens laid the babies in four cradles, rich and shiny.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Loud and troubled cries, the sons of Dasaratha emitted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Their persons, a puzzled Vasishta, to a close scrutiny submitted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"Oh, change the order in which the babies lie,"</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He said—"They should then cease to cry."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"Put the first twin's cradle next to the eldest;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Next to the second son's, place the youngest."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Now, by half, the cries reduced</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But by no means were they fully subdued.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Vasishta was thoroughly baffled</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And wondered how the cries could be stifled.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Soon he told Kaushalya, the chief queen and proud mother</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"Remove two cradles and lay the brothers together."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The instant it was done, the babies became quiet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Everyone realised: the slightest separation among the brothers meant disquiet.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Now the sage Vasishta had the pleasant duty</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To name the princes as per their attributes and beauty.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The eldest looked virtually like a forest of lotus flowers:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">His eyes resembled the petals of a lotus blossom that flutters</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">His nose matched a lotus' long and thin stem</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">His mouth, comparable to a lotus bud, was a veritable gem</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">His hands and feet were like soft lotuses in bloom</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And His limbs and torso were lotus clumps that dispelled gloom.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"Rama" was the name given to the eldest son and heir</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Gazing upon his 'rama' nay comely form, no one could tire.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"Bharatha" was the name bestowed on Kaikeyi's son</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Who was destined to rule the kingdom as a ‘Bhara,’ a burden</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama and Bharatha were dark of hue;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Telling them apart, very few could do.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Lakshmana and Shatrughna, the fair twins became</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As divine attendants, they were to attain permanent  fame.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Lakshmana was the epitome of 'Lakshmi,' richness in service</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Shatrughna considered direct service to God a 'shatru,' a disservice:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">His sole duty was to serve the devotee of the Lord</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In his lexicon, direct contact with the Lord was untoward.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama's incarnation was to establish obedience:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With what the elder says, the younger must show compliance.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Lakshmana's life was a standing example of 'seshatvam' or incessant service to God</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Bharatha, even better, showed 'parathanthriyam': he served as per the wishes of the Lord</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Shatrughna was the best: his character was difficult to get</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">On showing 'seshatvam' and 'parathanthriyam' to the Devotee, his mind was set.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Thus, Vasishta gave Ayodhya's princes names most apt,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While citizens in the kingdom looked on happy and rapt.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The sons of Dasaratha grew up fast</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Under Vasishta’s tutelage their learning was vast</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Before long, they reached twelve years of age<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And the King began to think about their marriage.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Just then Sage Vishwamitra entered Ayodhya city</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Hearing of it, Dasaratha prepared to observe every nicety.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The sage accepting the king's hospitality, straight to the point came:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To grant a request and keep to it, was Dasaratha game?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Impulsive Dasaratha, well pleased, agreed most readily</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He was used to making promises and sticking to them steadily.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Vishwamitra said: "Armies of monsters lay siege on my residence</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">They destroy divine sacrifices and of peace leave no semblance.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Send your eldest son Rama, the valorous one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To prevent my sacrifices from being undone.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He alone can annihilate every unscrupulous ogre</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Tranquillity for the world, their obliteration would augur."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">His words seared Dasaratha's ears like fire on wood</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Dry went his mouth and still his heart stood.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"Oh sage, he is but a boy, not yet sixteen;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He is not even of age to enter a battle so keen.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Let me come instead, to render protection</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I am amply qualified to perpetrate the demons' destruction.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At this response, Vishwamitra turned furious</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And said, "So! Your promise is spurious!"</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The world seemed to go red:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The sage's wrath caused a deep dread.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The wise Vasishta intervened in time and commanded:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"O King! You must do as the sage demanded."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"This sojourn with Vishwamitra is important</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The world will know Rama as the Omnipotent."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To his preceptor's command, Dasaratha offered no protest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He yielded Rama up to Vishwamitra's trust</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Everyone could see Rama comport Himself like a thing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That Dasaratha could hither and thither fling.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Vishwamitra, mollified, assuaged Dasaratha's fear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"You recognise Rama merely as your child, very dear.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But, I know that the entire cosmos is His child—</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">From everything mild to all that is wild.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You sit on a throne and indulge in worldly pleasure</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I sit at the Supreme's feet and consider Him my treasure."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"You wear a crown, while I wear matted locks</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I can recognise Rama, as one who forever to Him flocks.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You hold a sceptre, while I hold the 'Kusa' grass</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I see Raghava as the Spirit beyond the material and crass.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Know thou, it's time for the Almighty to fulfil His purpose</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Of destroying the wicked and defending the righteous."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Where man walks, his shadow follows—</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Where Rama goes, Lakshmana goes:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So, with Vishwamitra went Rama and Lakshmana, the incomparable</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As they followed the sage, their heroic bearing looked admirable.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Vishwamitra narrated many stories on the way</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Thus, the long distances and time quickly passed away.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">After leaving Ayodhya and upon reaching Sarayu's bank</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Vishwamitra called the divine boys to him as the sun sank.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He had decided to impart 'Bala' and 'Atibala', mantras most powerful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And said: "Dears, utter them with care; they make you vigorous and watchful.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Though you have the said qualities in ample measure,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In keeping you free from thirst, hunger and sleep, the mantras would prove a treasure."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The princes, in all humility and deference,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Accepted the sage's lessons with reverence</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Vishwamitra then instructed the youthful heroes to sleep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many tasks lay ahead of them, demanding and deep.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama, ever eager for the Learned and Wise’s guidance</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Was content to learn from Vishwamitra without hindrance.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The next day at dawn, Vishwamitra went up to the sleeping princes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He wanted to wake them in time for their morning chores and obeisances<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Looking upon Rama's sleeping form,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The sage got fully engrossed in His charm</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Spontaneously, he blessed the mother who had yielded such a son—</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama, who always gladdened minds, and hearts won.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Vishwamitra stood and stood, rooted to the spot:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama's loveliness is a net where every creature gets caught.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Finally, the sage shook himself and called with a soft diction:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"O! Tiger among men! Arise and get ready for action."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama and Lakshmana woke and concluded their morning duties</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The trio then continued on their way, noting the surrounding beauties.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One day they reached a place exceedingly desolate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It was fit to make anyone forlorn and disconsolate.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama asked the sage for an explanation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He replied: "It's Tataka, the demoness who destroys without discrimination."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Just then the demoness appeared on the scene</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Her size, aspect, and demeanour—all were obscene</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Vishwamitra ordered: "Quick Rama, kill her this instant."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But, Tataka's being a woman made Rama hesitant.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The sage urged: "She is a murderess, undeserving of pity.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Remember, killing her would relieve humanity."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama thought, “My father bid me obey the sage.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In pondering and vacillating, I must not engage."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The handsome warrior then shot a sharp arrow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It brought Tataka down like a wounded sparrow.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Flowers from the sky rained on Rama's head</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The place sprang to life—all the barrenness fled.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Vishwamitra looked on contentedly:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He praised and blessed the boys unstintingly.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Highly satisfied, Vishwamitra spoke to Rama thus:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"Let me give you divine weapons with powers that impress."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The ‘Modaki’ mace and similar hand-held ‘astraa’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The ‘Narayana’ and ‘Pinaaka’ and other missile ‘shastraa’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The sage gave to Raghava with grave piety</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And repeatedly blessed the illustrious one with safety.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"You have demonstrated not only courage</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But maturity and wisdom beyond your age.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There is none better suited to use these weapons</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In your hands they will become death to evil demons.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I gladly give them with my affection unfettered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Use them well and in sheltering the good, remain undeterred."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The intelligent Rama accepted the missiles with concentration intense</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He desired to get more missiles that He could use in defence.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Consenting, the sage bestowed annulment missiles on the Raghu scion</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With all the acquired knowledge, Rama resembled a glorious lion.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The deities of the missiles clustered round the young warrior</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And declared: "Serving you would ennoble our career."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The princes and Sage Vishwamitra then reached a locale lovely and tranquil</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Eager enquiries Rama made and politely awaited Vishwamitra's will.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The sage informed: "This ascetic dwelling is called Siddha Ashrama</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Originally, it belonged to the dwarf incarnation of Vishnu, Vamana.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This holy hermitage is a place of salvation</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To those seeking the divine in a spirit of devotion."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama now inquired with concern and regard</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When and where to mount their guard</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"For six days and nights you must be vigilant</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">During which time the demons' attack is imminent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Our Vedic ritual, they will be raring to spoil</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">By dropping offensive objects, the very place they will attempt to soil."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Accepting the decree, the brave brothers took position</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"No demon should defile this ritual," was their decision.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The relieved sages began their ritualistic activities</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While the youth paraded, in anticipation of hostilities<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">On the sixth night of the ceremony, the demons descended<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Towards wreaking havoc and perpetrating violence, their minds tended.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Mareecha and Subahu headed the vile fiends</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">They had no conception they were to meet their ends</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama and Lakshmana were relentless in battle</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And went through the demons like tigers among cattle</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The evildoers froze and then scattered in confusion</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the youths, they saw death like an illusion.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama killed Subahu without any effort, apparent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And dispatched Mareecha miles afar in a moment</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">By these couple of acts, the compassionate Creator told</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">How He deals with the sins of those who come into His fold:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Past sins, with one hand, He exterminates<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Present and future sins, with another, He disintegrates.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The sages completed the ceremony in peace</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Their vigil, Rama and Lakshmana could now cease.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Joy and harmony prevailed at the hermitage</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The brothers having averted every mishap and outrage</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Now, Vishwamitra and the other sages made a quick preparation:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Participating in a Vedic ritual at Mithila was their fond intention.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The sages addressed the gentle Rama in sweet tones</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And suggested the brothers join them in their journey to the North zones</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"At Mithila, ruled by the great-souled Janaka, you will find</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A very special bow from the Gods, hard to bind."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama, gladdening at the prospect, agreed promptly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And soon they all sallied forth on the momentous trip jauntily.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sri Mahalakshmi, Sriman Narayana's wife,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Took birth as Sita, Janaka's daughter and life.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Supreme's chest is Her permanent residence</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">From that perch, She dispenses solace and benevolence.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The divine couple perpetually remain together</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At the time of incarnations too, they invariably foregather.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For every soul, Sri is the trusty ally</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Like a steadfast mother, she always stands by.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When Narayana is filled with ire on perceiving the sins prevalent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">She wins His pardon with Her beauty and using fair argument</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">No one needs to worry with Her presence near</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Neither his own sins nor the Lord's wrath, he needs fear.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Thus it is that every devotee desires Sri and Narayana's unity</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For release from the birth-death cycle, their oneness provides the sole opportunity.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama and Sita's Union would bring universal welfare</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It would become as unguent for those in despair.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The wise and virtuous world looked forward to the event</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As one that would dispel darkness and make 'Dharma' prevalent.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At the time of Rama's visit, Sita had turned six</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Her marriage to a suitable groom, Janaka wanted to fix.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">After intense thought, he had determined to hold a test<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To select from amongst Sita's suitors the bravest and the best:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He thought, "The one to string the celestial Shiva's bow under my care,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Would indubitably make divine Janaki an ideal pair." <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The monotony of that long and hard journey, Vishwamitra varied<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">By regaling his companions with tales, he kept them unwearied<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Stories of Brahmadatta, and the river Ganga, and Uma and Karthikeya, her son<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Came forth from him in graphic detail and profusion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Further came narrations about the milk-ocean's churning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And Diti's seven sons becoming 'Maruts' or wind-gods with Indra's blessing. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Vishwamitra did not omit to speak about his own ancestry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama and Lakshmana listened with becoming attention to all that history.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In due course, they all reached Vishala, ruled by King Sumati<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And spent a night there accepting his hospitality<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As they approached Mithila, they got a glimpse of its majestic skyline<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For that city, with the princes in tow, the sages made a beeline. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">On the outskirts, they came upon a serene dwelling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Strangely though, the abode was devoid of any being<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama made enquiries of Vishwamitra inquisitively<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And the sage began to speak about the place knowledgeably:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"This is where the great sage Gautama long ago resided<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Here, with his lovely and chaste wife Ahalya, he presided. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Indra, the King of gods, had a wrongful desire<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Pleasure from Ahalya, he planned to acquire</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Assuming the guise of Gautama, the shameless being came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And sought Ahalya when she was alone, without fearing blame<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Though the exalted lady saw through the misguided god's disguise<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">She accepted him, as her vanity rendered her momentarily unwise. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sage Gautama saw through what had occurred</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And punished the duo for the sin they had Incurred<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Indra lost his testicles while Ahalya turned to stone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The sage became Himalayas-bound, leaving his wife to atone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">On Ahalya's pleading, the sympathetic Gautama soon amended his retribution:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">'Many years hence, from Rama's lotus feet, you shall receive purification'." <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Indeed, as the gentle Rama's feet touched the place<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ahalya emerged from her curse, sanctified by His grace<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sage Gautama too returned from where he had gone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And reunited with his wife thereupon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Together the couple worshipped Rama and made Him comfortable<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">They thanked Him repeatedly, the two ascetics, formidable.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Seeing Rama's activities, Vishwamitra felt joyous and blessed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Fortunate was he to be getting Rama and Sita wed.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">On, the group went and reached Mithila</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The divine kingdom that housed the Goddess of fortune, Sita.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Janaka came forward, offering a grand welcome</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With a joy inexplicable, he felt overcome.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Also appeared there Satananada, Janaka's priest and advisor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He knew, than Vishwamitra, there were few souls wiser.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While the elders exchanged civilities, the Royal brothers waited</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Watching the eminent ones, they felt elated.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Janaka and Satananada expressed curiosity about the distinguished youth</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The introductions were then made by Vishwamitra, the famous paragon of truth.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Satananada was grateful to Rama for restoring his mother</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For, he was Ahalya's son and none other</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The sage then narrated incidents from Vishwamitra's life as a tale</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To the acute fascination and gratification of Rama, in vivid detail</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Vishwamitra then desired Rama to "see" Shiva's bow:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The glorious lad was about to show His mettle, and how!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Five thousand strong men rolled in the cart holding the bow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Smilingly looked on by Rama, the One with the alabaster brow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For regular humans, the command "See" would mean just that, literally</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But, for the high-souled Rama, "Lift and see" is what it conveyed subtly.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Accordingly, Rama went up to the cart and lifted the bow playfully</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He strung it and pulled back the string nonchalantly.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A terrible sound rent the air at that instant</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Causing the earth to reverberate like thunder distant</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Most of those watching were stunned into swoons</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Janaka was thrilled as if he had earned invaluable boons.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He spoke to Vishwamitra: "Gladly will I give my daughter in marriage</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To this highly capable and potent young man of noble carriage."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Next, to confirm the alliance, he sent ministers to Rama's country</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And to invite Dasaratha for the wedding festivities with kith, kin and gentry</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The ministers did their bidding willingly and efficiently</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And secured the nods of Rama's elders satisfactorily.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Anon, the people of Ayodhya, eager to see Rama's bride</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Started for Mithila with delight pouring forth like a tide.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Arrived at Mithila, that capital of Videha, blessed by providence</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Dasaratha got a respectful welcome and Janaka's warmth in abundance</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Greatly content, the emperor of Kosala reciprocated</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With gifts and amiable words, the good Janaka he venerated</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The father's heart of Dasaratha welled up with pride</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While Janaka's heart pranced and his eyes tears of joy, cried.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama and Lakshmana strode up to take blessings from their parents</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Looking at them, Ayodhya's citizens felt affection and admiration in torrents</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The elders, post discussion, decided to conduct the marriages of all four princes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Videha had four suitable brides whose beauty and character smote the senses.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sita, sweet, wed Rama; Urmila, her sister, paired with Lakshmana,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Janaka's brother Kushadwaja's daughters, Mandavi and Shrutakirti married Bharatha and Shatrughna.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The wedding ceremony, per astrology and convenience, was fixed for an early date</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Enchanting looked the brides and grooms—verily like gods incarnate.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When the 'Uttara Phalguni' star was on the ascend and the time auspicious</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama and Sita were joined in matrimony, to the utter felicity of the pious.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The noble brothers of Rama too were married at the same time</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To Sita's comely sisters, who well knew their duties prime.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Janaka, performing 'kanyadaan' said: "O Rama, here is Sita, my daughter</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">She'll accompany you as you tread the path of justice and virtuous matter</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Take her with happy anticipation; May safety betide you;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Hold her hand in yours and become her all: this is your cue."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Upon which, Rama with joy and love boundless<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">United with Sita, whose glories are fathomless.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">King Janaka had to point Sita out explicitly—</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For, Her form was visible everywhere to bewitched Rama, implicitly.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">She came of the Videha dynasty, a clan highly reputable</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And was totally worthy of Rama, the most estimable.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In chastity, goodness and values , she was steeped so strong</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That she would never shy away from pointing out right from wrong</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Such were the assurances from King Janaka</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As he encouraged Rama to make haste and marry Sita</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And just before urging Rama to clasp Sita's hand with His</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Janaka imagined their joined palms and was lost to bliss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Recovering, he hurriedly blessed his magnificent son-in-law</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Lest any 'evil-eye' should at the newly-weds claw!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Beholding the tiger-like Rama and the doe-like Sita together,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">People experienced spiritual union with the universal mother and father.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It was as though time had come to a standstill at Mithila</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And cocooned the world in a nameless felicity, away from illusory samsara:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Super Soul is at the nucleus—like a peacock luxuriantly feathered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And every entity of the cosmos like a feather, to the Supreme is irrevocably tethered.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At the conclusion of the festivities, Dasaratha became desirous</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Of returning to Ayodhya with the princes and princesses.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Janaka and Mithila's dwellers bade them a tearful farewell</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And Kosala's entourage set forth after the exchange of rich gifts, without parallel</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">On the way, several birds set up an uproar frighteningly ominous</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A worried Dasaratha asked his astrologers to explain those sounds, raucous.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The prescient men said: "For certain, there is trouble ahead;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But, it will vanish as mist under the sun—no need to dread."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Just then the sky turned dark and there fell a spooky calm</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And Parasurama, the powerful ascetic with a violent disposition showed his form.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As he neared Dasaratha and his sons, He began addressing Rama directly:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"What glory did you gain by breaking an already damaged bow easily?"</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Once the gods created between Vishnu and Shiva a rift</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Shiva challenged Vishnu to a fight, his wisdom temporarily adrift:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The duo faced one another in an arena vast</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And each made war-sounds more terrifying than a volcanic blast</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Vishnu's 'humkaara' was enough to crack Shiva's bow—</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It established His supremacy without further ado or show.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Parasurama was the son of Jamadagni and Sage Bhrigu's descendant.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">King Karthaviryaarjuna became the cause for killing Jamadagni, the sage munificent.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Upon knowing this, 'Bhargava Rama' turned implacably wrathful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And vowed to wipe away twenty-one generations of Kshatriyas in full</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He had mastery over weapons and a stock of powerful Arsenal</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This ascetic turned revenge-seeker, who was not born to be banal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">On seeing him, panic-stricken Dasaratha, made an earnest prayer:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"Spare my sons—they are mere boys, O great 'Kshatriya'-slayer!"</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Parasurama, ignoring him, challenged Rama in a thunderous tone</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">"String 'Saarngaa' this bow of Vishnu I hold—then your potency I shall own.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you thus prove you are at my level,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I shall then deem You fit for any duel."</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Dasaratha Rama, unflinching and gracious, took the professed bow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And fit an arrow to it and gave Parasurama's aggressive arrogance a blow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Bhargava Rama then stood calm, having lost all his vigour and vanity:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama asked him for a target, for His poised arrows were endowed with irreversibility.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Parasurama offered as prey for the arrow the fruits of all his asceticism<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And before leaving to do penance, glorified Rama as the Superme, beyond criticism.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Having heard Parasurama's challenge, Dasaratha had started to tremble</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He saw Rama only as his delicate child and in fear had begun to crumble</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He had swooned before Rama could display His invincibility<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He awoke now to find everything in order and slowly regained sanity</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Even the Gods appeared and praised the young Rama's incredible deed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Dasaratha's retinue then continued forward with renewed speed.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Upon their reaching Ayodhya, special celebrations broke out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Spotting their beloved princes and their brides, the citizenry gave a jubilant shout</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama and His brothers, with their respective wives</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Enjoyed valuable family pleasures during that time in their lives</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">After a while, Bharatha and Shatrughna went to Kekaya for a stay</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Rama was busy taking care of people's welfare, as was ever His way.</span></p>
