<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i> </i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>After a year and a half in Chitrakoota’s charming environment</i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Rama moves into Dandaka, replete with nature’s nourishment</i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>He, with Sita and Lakshmana, lives there for over a decade</i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Visiting great ascetics whose wisdom surges forth like a cascade</i></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>The Story in Detail:</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b> </b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On quitting Chitrakoota, Rama and His companions walked ahead</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They came upon a gigantic monster whose form inspired dread</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The colossus, brushing aside the brothers, grabbed Sita and fled</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama and Lakshmana gave chase and climbed up to the giant’s head</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When hacking him yielded no significant result</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The clever and brave princes, with each other, began to consult</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana slid down and dug a large pit</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The monster, kicked hard by Rama, fell, heavily hit</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Quickly pushing him into the hole, Rama filled it</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">An incandescent person rose from there and spoke words, fit</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“O Rama, I have heard your lotus feet praised</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">From a long-standing curse, I know, Ahalya They raised.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Your immortal feet alone are able to grant deliverance</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">From the birth-death cycle, which sorely tests one's forbearance</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In material life, a mother and child recognise one another readily</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Though You understand us, why don’t we know the mother in You, easily? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Today, I, Viradha, have seen the power of Your feet first-hand</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I thank and salute thee, as before my eyes, You charmingly stand.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Kubera cursed me for hankering after his woman:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I have been wandering this earth ever since as a demon.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Being Sriman Narayana, the Supreme Being</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It is inexplicable why You hide in man’s garb, an exiled king!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama then replied: “O Viradha, I am pleased by your supplication</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Go towards your heavenly abode and acquire your designation.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On Viradha’s advice, Rama reached the precincts of Sarabhanga’s hermitage</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He went forward to announce their visit to that aged sage</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Near the entrance, He perceived Indra’s chariot and Airavath, his elephant white</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Stopping, He heard Indra and Sarabhanga conversing, with a smile quiet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Indra was putting forth an offer, “O sage, your austerities have been severe</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They make you eligible for heaven—believe my words, sincere.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sarabhanga replied, “Indra, my desire is to reach a place eternal:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A point of no return, where the soul experiences pleasures outside the carnal</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Neither your world nor even the ‘Satyaloka’ of ‘Brahma’ are places permanent</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In Narayana’s everlasting abode, Sri Vaikunta, I hope to become an ornament</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sri Rama will be here soon and upon me cast His compassionate eye</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Then my sins and good deeds alike shall vanish and at His eternal feet, I shall lie.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Indra soon took leave of Sarabhanga and stepped out</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He said to Rama: “You are the beginning and culmination, no doubt.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After Indra left, Sarabhanga invited Rama and His mates eagerly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And fulfilled a host's obligations towards guests, tenderly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Said he, “I have meditated on You for a thousand years and more</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And waited for Your peerless lotus feet to reach this door.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sarabhanga then sought Rama’s permission to enter fire</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And explained: “It is but an excuse to transcend this physical mire.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Saying thus, the ancient and venerable ‘<i>yogi</i>’ and sage</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Jumped into fire and sacrificed his earthly bondage</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Fate now propelled Rama, His beloved wife, and Lakshmana harder<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He had to fulfil His destiny of killing Ravana and establish order.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Now, Sutheekshana's audience, was what Rama sought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That sagacious hermit received Rama with humility, as he ought<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After plying the visitors with sufficient water and food<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sutheekshana requested Rama to remain with him, for good<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, Rama though grateful, would not comply<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"We cannot disturb the harmony of this place" was His reply.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After staying the night, Rama took the sage's permission<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sutheekshana gave leave and reminded Rama about His mission:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"The demons are ravaging this area with their heinous acts</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We are unable to perform our sacred duties: these are facts.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We rely on You, the supreme saviour, to come to our rescue<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Annihilate them: that is the course you must pursue."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Then, Rama, accompanied by Sita and Lakshmana went deeper into the forest</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And saw many huts amidst dense trees that housed saints truest</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Those residents waited to place the atrocities against them in Rama’s view</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">One of them yelled, “Rama is close—look how the trees reflect His divine hue!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Catching sight of Rama, those recluses with hearts unsullied</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Forgot their pain and to bless Him, forward they hurried.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Live thee long, dear King, with Your consort and queen</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">May no harm come upon You! May Your glory ever remain keen!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Devotees steeped in love for the Lord always place</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His wellbeing ahead of theirs, however hard the situation they face</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Their love blinds even their boundless wisdom:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They forget He is the omnipotent absolute of every Kingdom</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The devoted sages of Dandaka too blessed the Supreme for their part:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If He is well, fortunate remains creation, His counterpart<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama and His companions bowed as a mark of their respect</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Beholding the sages’ perturbed faces, Rama began to introspect</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Have I failed to learn their troubles and protect them?” He wondered</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“If so, I have been remiss—and have shamefully blundered.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">By patiently questioning and eliciting answers from each pious being</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The unpardonable crimes of the demons, Rama began seeing</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“I should long ere have come to you and wiped your tears</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I blush like a woman for failing to abate your fears</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Do not worry, dear souls. I make a solemn promise to you all</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I shall destroy every demon acting against Dharma: from today, that is my call.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The threesome then wended farther into the Dandaka jungles</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Where Rama met several more sages and carefully heard out their troubles.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita raised a doubt: “How can You wage war on someone without direct provocation?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama explained, “As Ayodhya’s royal agent, defending citizens is my vocation.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That dutiful wife and universal mother then felt placated in her heart</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“My husband will wipe the suffering of our devoted children and play His part.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana soaked in the natural beauty</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That Dandaka offered, along with its pristine bounty</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Looming mountains, clear lakes, and gently flowing rivers captivated</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">While fruits, roots and forest produce had them satiated</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The daily interactions with holy men and the living close to nature</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Exposed the three to an intimate and intense spiritual culture</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After passing close to ten years in a blissfully beneficent way,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama returned to Sutheekshana's hermitage for another short stay</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He expressed His wish to meet Sage Agastya, the pious and kindly soul</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sutheekshana, overjoyed, got ready to play the guide's role</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Agastya ‘<i>muni’</i> has made this part of the forest safe for the likes of us</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He protects us through his penance and powers, without a fuss."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Following Sutheekshana’s directions, Rama soon reached the dwelling of a sage</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Behold the hut of the brother of Agastya, who can quell any wicked rage.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vataapi and Ilvala were two 'rakshasas' tormenting pious folks here</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Agastya digested the former and burnt the latter, with his ascetic prowess, sheer."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Saying thus, Rama entered Agastya's brother's residence<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And bowed to that sage who shone with spiritual effulgence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After staying a night at the hermitage of Agastya's brother</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama, keen to meet Agastya, took leave of His host and walked farther.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Soon, He, Janaki and Lakshmana, entered a place filled with ethereal calm</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Just stepping into this place feels like a soothing balm</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This must be the exalted Sage Agastya's home</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Where even fierce creatures without animosity roam."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Lakshmana, by his mere presence the holy man has this place sanctified</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His gentle kindness and mercy cannot be adequately glorified.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Please make haste and enter his hut to announce our arrival</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Eager for his advice, I can hardly wait, even for a short interval."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Presently, Agastya, the omniscient sage with fame fathomless<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Stepped forth and welcomed Sri Rama with elation, boundless.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The sage presented them with refreshments, being hospitable</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And then narrated to Rama the demons' brutalities, most despicable</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Gathering Rama's intentions, Agastya showed approval</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And said: "Here are Vishnu's weapons; they must be at Your disposal."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He then handed over a powerful bow, two self-replenishing quivers and a sword:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“May these bring victory in your impending battles to establish '<i>Dharmic</i>' code!"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Then the trio spent the night with Agastya and his many disciples<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Upon waking, Rama made plans aligned with just principles</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He then took Sita and Lakshmana to nearby 'Panchavati' at Agastya's behest</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The sage had predicted: "For future events to take shape, that location would be best.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Injustice, wherever it exists, is a threat to justice everywhere</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You’re poised to uproot evil and bring peace: of this, I’m aware.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Walking towards Panchavati, Rama and His companions came upon a mammoth vulture</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama approached the bird, suspecting it to be a demonic creature<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, the mighty bird spoke in a sweet voice: “Dear boy Rama, I am your father’s friend.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I am glad to welcome You here and shall look after Your welfare from my end.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The brothers and Sita became happy at finding a well-wisher in the remote spot</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama thought of him as His father, whose loss had made Him distraught<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Jatayu then proceeded to narrate the history of creation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He spoke about the ancestry of animals, birds and humans without hesitation</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“I am the offspring of Aruna, the charioteer of the Sun</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I have an elder brother, Sampati, who has for me, much affection.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You are my beloved friend’s son and I feel responsible</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">For protecting you all from predators and demons terrible.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Panchavati, on the banks of River Godavari, proved an enchanting place</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Where every prospect pleased and of evil, there was apparently no trace.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama found a suitable spot for their stay and instructed:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Dear brother, raise a residence that cannot be easily destructed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Build a charming hermitage where Sita and I would delight</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Let it also be a place that gratifies you and makes your heart light."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hearing Rama's words, Lakshmana shot at Him a look of alarm</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Have you decided to abandon me?” asked he, the one with the steady arm</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A chagrined Rama questioned: "What have I said to cause you this anxiety?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I only directed you to serve me, don't I well know your piety?"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana replied: "One must act only to gladden Your heart</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">At Your delight, one must rejoice, and from this rule I never depart"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana continued, "I don’t entertain a single independent thought</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I shall always depend on and look unto you, no matter what."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hearing these words of acumen, Rama was overjoyed</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And exclaimed, "When you're beside me, I always feel buoyed"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana then quickly raised a ‘<i>Parna Shala</i>’ highly captivating:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">For Rama and Sita’s solitude, He had designed a room, enchanting.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama carefully inspected the abode Lakshmana had erected</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He saw several beautiful rooms that His brother’s skills reflected</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama had wanted a private chamber, but had felt shy to say so:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Noticing the secluded room Lakshmana had built, He uttered a grateful “Oh!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Soumitri, you fulfil my wishes like my own father</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">About stating them explicitly, I never have to bother.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A soul that wishes to serve the supreme must follow Lakshmana's example:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">One must think about what would please the master, without preamble.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Any action that appeals to the super soul is 'Dharmic' and just</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Anything that causes pain to Him is sinful and unjust</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It is essential to note: when a person acts from this perspective,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The ego is diminished and all his actions become constructive</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The three began their sojourn at Panchavati on a peaceful note</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The place had donned nature’s exquisite and plentiful coat<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">One day at dawn, Rama and Lakshmana with a view to taking a bath</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Headed for the Godavari river and strolled along their customary path</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On entering the waters, the brothers shivered in the cold</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In Lakshmana’s mind, Bharatha’s torment began to unfold</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Turning to Rama, that affectionate brother said: “This water is so chill.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">How much icier it must be for Bharatha, our brother with a strong will?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He bathes in the Sarayu, in the wee hours of the dawn</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Wishing to stay well away from our citizens’ scorn</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He is reluctant to hear them say: “Here goes the sinner</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Who separated from us that noble Rama, our life-giver!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Listening to Lakshmana’s words, Rama was seized by an emotional frenzy</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“I am returning to Ayodhya this instant,” said He, working Himself into a tizzy</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Enough of keeping My word to our father!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I cannot stay away from Bharatha any longer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Whether you concur with me or not, I shall not consider</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I shall unite with my brother and remain at his side forever.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It was not in Rama’s nature to retract from His vow</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His blinding love for Bharatha His response did but show<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana, taken aback, wondered how to restore Rama’s equanimity</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He quickly started talking about Kaikeyi and her sudden decline from amity</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">At this Rama stopped him and begged: “Don’t cast aspersions on our mother</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After all, she is the one who yielded us Bharatha, that treasure-like brother.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In truth, however, Bharatha, excessively feverish from the agony of separation</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Never felt the chill of Sarayu's waters in his affliction</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Like a freshly baked brick that is dipped in cold water makes the water hot</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With Sarayu’s cold waters, Bharatha’s emotions passionately fought</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Every single day for fourteen years, that epitome of devotion</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Carried Rama in his heart on a throne of unwavering adoration</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To Rama, though Lakshmana was near, Bharatha was dear</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Any indication of pain to him stabbed at Him like a spear</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana’s timely distraction brought Rama back to His duty:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His promise of shelter given to the ‘<i>sadhus</i>’ was His treaty.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This incident, however, brings forth the depth of His feeling:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Where it concerns His devotee, Rama is not above losing His bearing <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Passing their time pleasantly on Panchavati’s verdant lap</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana entered the last year of exile without mishap</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, as fated, trouble arrived in the form of Shurpanaka, the demoness<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She perceived Rama, and enamoured by His looks, craved His caresses</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Though Rama and Shurpanaka were opposites in character and attractiveness</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Shurpanaka became a prisoner to lust and sensuousness.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama’s face was like a lotus bloom while Shurpanaka’s was unsightly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He had a slender and taut waist whereas she was hefty and ungainly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama’s hair coiled like a sinuous black cobra while Shurpanaka’s was bleached</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His voice was sweet as nectar whereas hers jarred as she screeched!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To create a favourable impression, Shurpanaka decided on deceit</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">An idea hatched in her mind, loathsome in spirit</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Changing into a comely maiden, she approached Rama and queried:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Who are you? To you, who shine like a divine being, I wish to get married.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama introduced Himself as the son of Dasaratha, Ayodhya’s emperor</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And narrated the events that culminated in His exile with His wife and brother</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He then enquired: “Now, will you tell me about yourself?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Shurpanaka replied: “I am the sister of the demon King Ravana himself.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She continued, “I have fallen for your charms and long to make you mine</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Marry me, O Rama, struck as I am by you, who is brighter than moonshine.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Smilingly Rama said: “I am a married man; here you see Sita, my wife</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I have vowed that I shall not even gaze upon another woman in my life.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Why don’t you ask my brother Lakshmana who stands here?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Though he too is married, his wife is not near.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To pair up with the equally handsome Lakshmana, Shurpanaka was not averse</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She said to him: "Marry me; together, many lovely places we shall traverse.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana rejected her offer and said: “I am Rama’s slave and nothing more.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A lady like you deserves none but the one at the fore.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Accepting his decree, the demoness went back to Rama with her request</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Once again Rama declined and directed her to Lakshmana in jest</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When the brothers treated Shurpanaka thus, she lost her patience</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And grabbing and throttling Sita, she gave vent to her grievance</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Promptly, Rama motioned to Lakshmana with His eyes</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Who slashed away Shurpanaka’s nose and ears in a trice</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The demoness let out an agonised roar that shook the very ground</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And ran helter-skelter with fury in her breasts that stood up like a mound</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Shurpanaka headed straight for Janasthana inhabited by Khara, her sibling</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Collapsing at his feet in a pool of blood, she began raving and ranting:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Handsome youths named Rama and Lakshmana have insulted me thus</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Though gentle, they can handle even powerful demons without a fuss.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama has large eyes like a couple of lotuses lovely</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The youth, clad in dark deer-skin, appear lively."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Shurpanaka’s praise confirms the impression the Supreme makes on every creature</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His attributes fascinate even the wickedest—that is the diktat of nature</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Then recollecting herself, Shurpanaka gave further details of the brothers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And warned Khara about their intent and the inherent dangers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“We cannot allow them to continue here—they pose a risk for our kind</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They are sure to destroy us, who love to be unjust and unkind.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“The princes of Ayodhya wield powerful bows and are well versed in battle arts</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Before they assault us, you must rout them out from these parts</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita, that voluptuous beauty, is Rama’s wife and dearer to Him than life</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When I tried gobbling her, Lakshmana chopped me with his sharp knife.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Unless and until I see Sita’s blood, I shall not know any peace</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Only after I eat her and the royal brothers, my fury shall cease.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Khara dispatched his formidable assistants, who numbered twelve<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Certain they would kill the humans, his concern he did shelve</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, when Shurpanaka brought back news that the demons had perished at Rama's hand</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Khara sent his brother Dushana with fourteen thousand more from his select band</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">At the advent of the huge army, even the Gods appeared:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">One against fourteen thousand was appalling and weird.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama stood like a rock while the demons descended on Him like waves</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His countenance shone with a smiling light that scared those knaves</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama then raised His bow and began releasing sharp arrows<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The sky became thick with His flying missiles, chilling the demons' marrows</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">All of a sudden, Rama seemed to disappear from His place</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He discharged arrows with such speed that He became a blur without a face.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Within a few hours, the invincible Rama decimated that army's force</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And as He stood, the blood pouring forth from Him resembled a river’s course</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Khara, shocked by the defeat of his mates, met Rama in face-to-face combat</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Very soon, his spirit left for the realms it deserved, while his body lay flat</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The heavenly denizens rained happy flowers in profusion</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And praised the Raghu scion's prodigious feat in effusion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita commended Rama thus: “Lord of lords of infinite virtue</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You have established Dharma, which the demons eternally eschew</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Were my father to see You this day, He would feel proud</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">About having given my hand to a man whose valour speaks aloud.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Let me tend to Your wounds from the battle</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Every one of them represents justice and shows Your mettle.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The elated Sita ran up to Her heroic husband and embraced Him fondly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Her touch that held the power of all medicinal herbs, healed Him magically</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That day, Akhampana was the only demon that got away from death<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hidden as he was in woman's apparel, Rama had not snuffed out his breath</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This demon and Shurpanaka now fled to Ravana in a dead fright:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They had to warn their king about Rama and His indefatigable might<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Akhampana informed Ravana about Khara-Dushana’s defeat</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That king forgot to enquire how that battle their army could forfeit</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“When every one of Khara’s demons is overthrown and dead,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Explain how you are here” Ravana wondered, instead.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Akhampana, whose name meant ‘the one who never trembles’</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Boldly praised Rama thus: “I posed as an inoffensive lady, knowing cruelty alone Rama humbles.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Next Shurpanaka came forward with her mutilated features and told her story</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To entice her brother, she cunningly described first Sita’s beauty and glory</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Then she said, “Though Rama and Lakshmana are mere humans</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It is inexplicable that their powers should be far superior to us demons</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Better to trim their hostile onslaught at the outset</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">By harming Sita, you can damage Rama’s spirit and have Him upset”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“A sorrowful and broken Rama is unlikely to put up a fight</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Melancholy will rob Him of all His strength and make him contrite.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Cruel minds always seek and succumb to bad advice</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Here too Shurpanaka’s words appealed to Ravana, the unwise.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He foolishly thought of fingering Rama, that tiger among men</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And decided upon kidnapping Sita and bringing Her to his den.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Driven by lust and fear, Ravana went to meet Mareecha, his uncle</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Who was a cunning trickster and of every atrocity, capable</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, the moment Ravana mentioned Rama, that hardened demon turned ashen</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And in a low voice asked: “Who gave this idea that would your death fashion?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When a person’s end is near, his mind stoops to horrific deeds</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Fate propels him towards doom and to the best of wisdom, he seldom heeds</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana, piqued, demanded the reason for Mareecha’s dread</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That demon explained why in Rama’s path it was useless to tread</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Many years ago, when with Rama I was fool enough to fight<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That mere boy, with His bow and arrows, put me to flight</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Flung infinitely far from His presence, I recognised His power:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It can only be the Supreme’s, against which every one must cower.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Know Rama not as a human, but as the ultimate Lord Himself</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Keep away from Him, if you want to save your kinsfolk and yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Thus did Mareecha, intrepidly counsel Ravana, the malevolent being</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, his advice fell on deaf ears, and Ravana remained unseeing</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Harshly he spoke: “I want you to kidnap Sita by using your tricks</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If you dare defy me, I shall squish you like a few ticks.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Poor Mareecha realised that his death awaited him</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And decided to die at Rama’s hands rather than at Ravana’s whim</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He said: “I see there is no point in warning you</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To invite death, meddling with the divine couple Rama and Sita is the perfect cue.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Turning myself into a golden deer, I shall in front of Sita prance</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And tempt Her to ask Rama for me as a pet: I well know the nuance.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“You will hide nearby in the guise of a holy Sage</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">While the noble Rama, I shall lure far away and engage</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Eventually, Rama will strike me down with His sharp arrow</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I shall yell for Lakshmana’s help and for that Rama’s voice I shall borrow</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When the coast is thus fully clear, in front of Sita, you shall appear</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And snatching Her quickly, you shall return: do you hear?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana applauded Mareecha’s plan and agreed to go with it</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Let us act immediately; for bold people, procrastinating is unfit”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Mareecha instantly changed into a wondrous deer with a golden tint</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His body had jewel-like spots—of shiny gems they gave a hint</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He frolicked and frisked enticingly in front of Rama’s hut</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita longed to have it as a pet and watched it strut.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Soon, She turned to Rama and said: “Please capture that deer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It will be company and live with us forever without fear.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama was determined to fulfil His wife’s desire</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He left to seize that deer, unaware that it was akin to playing with fire</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana stopped Rama and said: “This deer is a fake.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We have neither heard of nor seen this sort of beast in our wake.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Also, look at how the other deer in the herd keep away from it</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It is a demon transformed: don’t give chase, use Your wit.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, Rama consoled Lakshmana thus: “Don’t be anxious</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I am eager to please Sita—of this stag, she is desirous.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Asking Lakshmana to guard Sita, Rama went near that stag</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The animal ran a short distance and looked back—He was not one to lag</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama ran after the deer but it remained just at arm’s length</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After a long while, He realised that Lakshmana’s case had strength</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Releasing a powerful arrow, He slay that enchanted deer</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As it fell, it yelled “hey Sita, hey Lakshmana”—inducing in Rama a nameless fear.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The astute Rama realised that it must be Ravana's redressal<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">For Khara-Dushana's death, He was facing a reprisal</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama wondered: “Why did this demon shout in my voice?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I sense danger and must hurry back instead of losing my poise.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">While Rama was thinking thus, Sita turned paranoid</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And asked Lakshmana to seek Rama—of Her senses becoming devoid.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Your elder brother is in peril and cries for your assistance</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You must rush; don’t stand here and put up resistance.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But Lakshmana refusing to budge, tried placating his sister-in-law</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“No one can harm Rama, the Lord of all creation,” he reassured without a flaw</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita, however, was incensed and began uttering words unfair:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To say such words against that pure-souled Lakshmana, none would dare</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“You want to see your brother dead and are not to be trusted</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> You perhaps also hanker for me: your moral code has rusted.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Unable to bear Sita’s accusations and piercing taunts</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana reluctantly decided to give in to her wants</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He drew a line of guard, a ‘<i>Lakshman Rekha</i>’, around their hut</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And begged Sita to always stay within that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He then prayed to all the elements of nature:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Please safeguard Sita: I am uneasy about the future.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana then set out from there at a run</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To seek Rama, that invincible ornament of the dynasty of the Sun</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In a trice, the evil Ravana who had been hiding, revealed himself</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He was disguised as a ‘<i>sadhu</i>’ to conceal his true self<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“<i>Bhavathi bhiksham dehi,</i>” that horrid creature cried</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Asking for alms, like any real sage, and of retribution, unafraid.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita came out of the hut and bowed before the demon king</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And went in to fetch food worthy of a sadhu’s offering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When she tried to drop the alms into the bowl Ravana held</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That unworthy creature stepped back—in his eyes anger welled</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He said: “How dare you serve me from within your home’s precinct?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You lack etiquette and fail to esteem exalted souls: that is distinct.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“I shall proceed to curse you dreadfully and also your clan</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Unless you step out and relieve my hunger that is turning me wan.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Alas, that innocent princess, fell for the trickster’s ruse</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And stepped over Lakshmana’s line, to stop the sage’s abuse</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana, tearing off his mask, stood revealed as a monster</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita swooned away and fell to the ground without a bolster.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana uprooted and lifted the ground on which Sita lay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And gloating over his burden, began flying away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita woke to find herself in the demon’s clutch</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And began wailing for help: “Recuse me from this wretch.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Oh, trees, flowers, deer and peacocks, tell my Rama what occurred</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Oh, river Godavari, narrate this abduction by Ravana, the thief and coward.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When Ravana began flying higher, Sita felt helpless<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Her cries for help fell on the ears of Jatayu, that giant bird selfless</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Jatayu came with outstretched wings and clawed at Ravana valiantly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The demon took his ‘Chandrahasa’ sword and chopped down his wings derisively</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The poor bird fell to earth and lay in a death swoon</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And felt forlorn about abandoning Sita, whose voice paralleled a bird’s croon</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita, horrified by Jatayu's plight, started mourning aloud</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I committed two sins: my life they have begun to cloud.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Having Rama, who represents everything next to me, I hankered for a deer</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And I flung words at Lakshmana that were hideous and hurtful to hear</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">For the former and latter, I shall have two sufferings: one small and one vast</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Lord forgives insults to Himself but alas, never to a devotee who is steadfast."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Now, Ravana tried luring Sita with riches and a position of his empress</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The pure lady shunned them and said: "Vanity, lust and greed, the wise repress.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You do not realise that you have inserted your arm into a venomous snake's lair</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Never doubt it: My beloved Lord Rama will punish you and take back His wife, fair.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If you have an iota of sense, recognise the impending peril</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Handing me respectfully over to Rama is the only way to escape his ill-will."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"You have grievously injured Jatayu, who was to the three of us a father</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And you stole me away sneakily like a craven and a robber</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I am a 'pathi-vratha' who is faithful to her husband in mind, word, and deed</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Before submitting to you or your riches, I'll give up my very breath, indeed."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita's bold admonition infuriated Ravana, the mean fellow with a black heart</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And he started flying higher and faster: advice to him, none could impart!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita perceived a group of pious-looking monkeys on a lush mountain peak</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Removing her jewels and tying them in her scarf, she dropped them like a streak</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Please let these show Rama the route in which I am being taken</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And convey my courage and conviction to Him, who must be thoroughly shaken.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">May these monkeys hand over to my husband the jewel pouch!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">May they remember to mention my forced flight and my present safety, vouch."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana, provoked by Sita's reprimands, failed to notice her clever act</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And the brave princess' faith in Her husband, which nothing could impact.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The demon king now flew over an ocean, verily intimidating</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, Sita who had Rama in Her heart, remained unflinching<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ravana said, landing in his kingdom Lanka at a spot beauty-laden:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Till you consent to be my wife, you shall remain a prisoner in this Asoka garden."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Rama who was returning, and Lakshmana met each other</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama said: “Sita is in danger; you should have held your post, dear brother.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The princes rushed back with fear chilling their hearts</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Their presentiment came true and an empty hut hit them like darts</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Running hither and thither, the brothers looked for Sita and cried out her name</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When they couldn’t find her, Rama knew not whom to blame.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In His welter of emotions, Rama felt the world whirling round and round</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Distracted and dizzy, that ever-upright spirit slid to the ground<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana sat next to his brother and calming him spoke thus:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Rama, this is no time to give in to melancholic or pessimistic fuss</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We must move forward and gather all possible clues</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And learn Sita’s whereabouts: hence, shed Your blues.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama sat up swiftly and announced with a face diffused with anger:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“If the Gods fail to return my Sita today, I shall make the earth stagger.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana consoled Him again and soon the brothers were on their feet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And went looking for the lost lady, Rama’s sweet and eternal helpmeet</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Presently they stumbled upon Jatayu lying in a pool of blood</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama rushed to him with tears pouring down in a flood.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“O mighty bird, why do you lie thus, fainting and prostrate?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Who attacked you so pitilessly: to learn this I am desperate.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Jatayu slowly opened his eyes and perceived Rama’s anxious face</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“May thee live long, dear son,” said he, before narrating his case</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“I heard Sita’s screams and saw Ravana fly south bearing Her away</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Realising You must be far, I tried to stop him till You could come this way.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Alas, I failed to save Sita, who charms like a child</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, I am content to die in Your service,” said that wise vulture from the wild</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And looking intently at Rama’s face and into His lotus eyes</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Jatayu closed his own eyes and gave up his mortal ties</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A desolate Rama commanded: “May you reach the realm of permanence!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ascend to ‘<i>Vaikunta</i>’ and decorate My space with your sacrifice and presence.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Through this incident, Jatayu set an example for genuine devotion:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">By sacrificing his life in the Lord's service, he derived satisfaction</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama too demonstrated the duty the Supreme Being must discharge</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Of giving salvation to all created beings, He alone was in charge</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Though a bird, He blessed Jatayu with '<i>moksha</i>', without any condition</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He exposed His Supreme nature here, despite assuming a human incarnation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Now Rama said: “The breaking of my heart should make a crack far greater:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">How am I to handle my misfortunes that gape like a bottomless crater?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I lost not only my crown and my father, but also my beloved wife</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">All these I accepted—but, how to replace Jatayu, who forfeited his life?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Having lost my adoring father, I was happy to greet this bird magnificent</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I wanted to live under his wings; but even that desire has turned out transient.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Wailing thus, Rama lit a funeral pyre around Jatayu’s remains</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And set it ablaze with His own hands, forgetting His pains<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Next, the brothers began moving in a southern direction:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To await further developments was now their only option</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When night fell, Rama became inconsolable<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He sighed repeatedly at the loss of Sita, His wife adorable</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Oh, why doesn't the sun appear in the east and end my passion</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Being my dynasty's head, he should show me some concern</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Perhaps, he is ashamed of my inability to safeguard my wife</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His name would be tarnished: over this, his mind must be in strife</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, unless he comes, the night and my sorrow will go on</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And I shall languish this way and perish without seeing another dawn."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In this manner, Rama suffered acute torment</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">While Sita, on the other side, had all Her senses in a ferment</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama became thirsty and Lakshmana went in search of waters</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On his way, he was waylaid by ‘Ayomukhi,’ an ogress<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She lifted him up into the sky with a flourish</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When Lakshmana failed to return, Rama fell into a deep anguish</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Determined to take His own life, Rama prepared to light a fire</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When He heard a sound as though someone were in straits dire</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Fearing Lakshmana might be in danger, Rama turned pale</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Towards the sound, at three times the speed of wind, He raced like a gale</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana had finished Ayomukhi off by the time Rama reached</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And Rama beholding him thought, "A rule I have breached."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He said, "Lakshmana, we should always stay and move together<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Enough trouble have we faced by straying from each other."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana saw Rama's distress and full of concern he said:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I've killed the fiend who attacked me; Your anxiety, please do shed."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Soon came a day when the brothers felt surrounded by a vast force</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It seemed to crush them in, allowing no escape or recourse.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Suddenly Rama began to laugh and said: “The demon army has us surrounded</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We can vanquish them and rescue Sita before She is further hounded.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, the alert Lakshmana replied: “Out of your eagerness You see the demon troop</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">There are no battle indications—no war cries or drumbeats through the air swoop.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Then they saw a monster’s arms and perceived a mouth in its belly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To imagine anyone could get away from its powerful clutch seemed too silly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama cried: “So, this is how we are to end—oh, what a shame!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I am about to bring infamy to the Ikshvaku dynasty’s name.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana motivated Rama thus: “Don’t forget we are warriors</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We must fight wholeheartedly and attempt to break down barriers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">My mother has asked me to give up my life in protecting Sita and You</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I shall fight till my last breath; our fate You need not rue.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With renewed vigour, Rama and Lakshmana hacked at the colossus</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When they severed its arms, there arose a divine figure from the lifeless masses</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This figure introduced himself as Kabandha, a denizen from heaven</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And said “To take this form, by a sage’s curse, I was driven.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama, You are the beginning of and the reason behind all creation</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, You stand apart from all material manifestation.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In Your quest for Your consort, Rama, You need a friend’s support</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">From the monkey chief Sugriva, about Sita, You will get a report <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You must go further South and seek the ‘ashram’ of Shabari the ascetic<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She will give you directions to reach Rishyamukha and Sugriva, the rustic</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Saying this, the being ascended to the regions where he belonged</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama’s hopes revived, though his parting from Sita was prolonged.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Proceeding swiftly and eagerly, the duo reached Shabari’s abode</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That disciple of Sage Matanga was awaiting them and bowed</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After seating Rama comfortably, a variety of fruits Shabari proffered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She bit and tested these for sweetness before they were offered</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The gracious Rama, without dissent, accepted every part of her welcome</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The elderly ascetic was by a sublime bliss overcome.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Why did Rama decline Guha’s food, but accept Shabari’s without discord<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Because Shabari served by her preceptor’s word, while Guha did of his own accord</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The spiritual master’s true words become law even for the Supreme:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hence, every being should follow an ‘<i>Acharyan</i>’ with spiritual knowledge extreme</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Shortly, Rama asked for directions to the ‘Rishyamukha’ mountain</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Giving the route in minute detail, many landmarks did Shabari mention.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Shabari then requested Rama’s permission: "I must drop this body, physical</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Your loving gaze has neutralised my sins, inimical<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Let me go to Sri Vaikunta and involve in Your eternal service</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Your lotus feet help anyone cross the materialistic precipice<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You shall meet Sugriva very soon and pledge friendship</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With his aid, You shall find Sita and eradicate Her hardship."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After Shabari ascended to the highest realms, Rama and Lakshmana started</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Once more on the quest for Sita, from whom they were now parted</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They wanted to reach Lake Pampa, where lived Sugriva, the valiant ape</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And with him forge a friendship that would their future mission shape</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sugriva lived there with his minister, Hanuman, and a band of loyal mates</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He was in hiding from his unjust brother and biding his chance to turn the plates.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Why did Rama and Sita go through such difficulties?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They could have accomplished their mission using Their unlimited faculties.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, the merciful Couple came down to earth to liberate Their children</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To effectively free drowning mortals, They jumped into samsara's burning cauldron</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">While Rama had pledged to wipe out the diabolical forces</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita voluntarily got imprisoned to liberate the divine women in Ravana's clutches.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When Rama entered the beautiful precincts of the Pampa lake,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His sense of despondency, the charming surroundings did rake<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He lamented, "O Lakshmana, this cheerful space intensifies Sita's absence</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I do not know how to prolong life without her pleasing presence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Look at how the fish that resemble Sita's eyes swim away and hide<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Though they try to prevent my tears thus, my eyes refuse to remain dried."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“The gods are injurious; they have stolen my jewel</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On what my darling must suffer, I dare not dwell</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Of Her alone, everything that is lovely reminds me</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Till the day I see Her well, myself I shall not be</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The nights seem extended and go on forever</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Sun, disdainful at my losing Sita, seems to rise never.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Eventually though, the pleasing environs put heart into that woeful husband:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama became optimistic about rescuing His wife from Ravana, the brigand</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The brothers quickened their pace and for Mt. Rishyamukha they headed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With their upright and noble carriage, they resembled gods the evil dreaded</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Standing beside the lake, the two surveyed the scenery</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And recalling Shabari's pointers, further on, they began to hurry.</span></p>
