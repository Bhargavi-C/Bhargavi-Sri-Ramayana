<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Story in Detail:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama and the other princes spent twelve years in amity and conjugal bliss</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In the perfect justice of Rama's conduct and service, none could find anything amiss</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Dasaratha felt satisfied that his eldest son was fit to succeed as King</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He called his counsel and made clear his longing:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I wish to place my crown on Rama's young head.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Do I have everyone's consent and blessings to go ahead?"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Upon hearing this, all those gathered hailed him with a yell of glee</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">One bold youth even said, "O, old King, it's time for you to flee."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Dasaratha was thoroughly pleased with the welcome for his decision<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But felt rather taken aback and overwhelmed by the people's effusion.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He asked, eager to hear his son praised:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"How did Rama impress you? I wish to be apprised."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The ministers conveyed their opinion: "Rama is equanimous, just and merciful."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vasishta and other learned men asserted: "To wise counsel He is ever open and respectful."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vassals proclaimed, "Rama wears His qualities like so many crowns</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He should wear Ayodhya's crown too: this we readily pronounce.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The common people declared, "Rama is mother and father to us</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In fulfilling our needs and correcting our deeds, he is assiduous."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Is that so?," exclaimed Dasaratha, his paternal heart full</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And the citizens continued praising his son whose walk was that of a bull</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"When there is a melancholy event, Rama mourns before the mothers rue</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And when there is cause for joy, He celebrates before the men do</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To Rama, we are always first and foremost;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We are His, and that is our grateful boast."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Dasaratha expanded with happiness and pride</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"What good deeds did I perpetrate to beget this son?" he cried</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In this manner, the whole of Ayodhya became immersed</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In an ocean of happy contemplation, not knowing it was accursed:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">For, difficult times were ahead of this great nation:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A direct result of the proposed coronation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The King took Sage Vasishta's advice and decided</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To place Rama on the throne the very next day, as guided</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Dasaratha then sent for his son, and holding Him in a fond embrace said:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Tomorrow, you shall be King with this empire under your head."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama, as was his wont, took the momentous news in a detached spirit:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Not succumbing to emotional upheavals was His especial merit.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vasishta then instructed Rama to perform certain purificatory rites</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And added: "Reflect on authority and its responsibilities; it will take you to heights."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A throng awaited Rama as He emerged from the meeting</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They wanted to catch a glimpse of Him and offer their greeting</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama headed for His quarters to prepare for the crowning</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">While the citizens, in untold merriment, slowly began drowning.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Manthara, Queen Kaikeyi's personal maid, saw the intense celebration</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Curious, she enquired: "What's the cause for this jubilation?"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On being told about Rama's proposed ascension to the throne</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The wretched hunchback let out a horrified moan</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rushing to Kaikeyi, she cried, "O dear, naive mistress!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama is to become king tomorrow: what more cause for distress?"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The delighted queen presented Manthara with her necklace</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But the maid threw it aside in a frenzy, reckless.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Rama shall be emperor and Bharatha His slave;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Kaushalya will be queen mother, while your position turns grave."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Thus, Manthara injected poison into Kaikeyi's simple mind</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Till the queen completely forgot what it was to be kind.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Once Kaikeyi had saved the King from a battlefield</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And by tending his wounds had got him healed</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Dasaratha had granted her two wishes, feeling grateful<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Never suspecting they would drag him to his death, most dreadful.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Manthara now told Kaikeyi the means to achieve her ends</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Use the boons Dasaratha accorded you long back, without amends.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Go and lie down in the 'Palace of Ire'</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Remove all your jewels and lament till you hear Rama's sire</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When he asks you to explain the reason for your animosity</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Redeem the boons he had given you out of generosity:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Bharatha must become king in Rama's stead;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">For fourteen years to the forest, He must go—the one Sita wed"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Don't waver from your demands even a wee bit:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The King will try to dissuade you with emotional appeals and his keen wit."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Manthara's misleading words gave Kaikeyi a new resolution</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She marched towards generating chaos and dissolution</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Melancholy and misery, like dark clouds, loomed unseen</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Very soon, there was to be a change of scene.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Kaikeyi resolutely walked into the palace where resentful queens went</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The King should resolve their problems: for that, the place was meant</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Dasaratha wanted to share the news of Rama's coronation with his favourite spouse</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Learning where Kaikeyi was, he wondered, "What could be her grouse?"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hastening to her presence and seeing everything helter-skelter</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The poor King felt a cold hand upon his heart and went all a-twitter.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Dasaratha gently enquired of Kaikeyi what the matter was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I want to claim the two boons you gave," she said, after a pause</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The relieved King cheerfully indicated his willingness</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And Kaikeyi began to make her cruel requests with utter callousness</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Bharatha must be crowned King—that's the first boon I crave</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">For the second boon I ask for fourteen years of exile for Rama, the brave.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">One moment her words hit Dasaratha's ear</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And the next, he fell in a heap, struck with shock, sheer</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Incredulously and with a pleading glance</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He looked at Kaikeyi as though from an agonising trance</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Someone tell me I am in a nightmare</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You cannot have uttered those words I am ill-attuned to bear."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, Kaikeyi, with set face reaffirmed her demand</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To the King, it became clear that she was beyond reprimand</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, he tried reasoning with many appeals piteous</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"O queen, when did you turn so unjustly covetous?"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When the King saw her unmoved, he attempted a compromise<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I shall make Bharatha King—Rama would be pleased, it’s my confident surmise."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"But, please do not separate Rama from me</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">My very breath is at stake, I implore thee."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">None of Dasaratha's pleas bore any fruit</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He realised, his glory and happiness, Kaikeyi was about to loot</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As an Ikshvaku scion, he could not go back on his undertaking</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He had to bear the cruellest consequences in the making.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">                 <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"So be it—but, from this moment, you cease to be my wife<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharatha is no longer my son, remember this, you harbinger of strife,"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The King cried thus and fell in a faint</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His hapless ordeal and suffering, no words could paint</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Kaikeyi saw that she had to tell Rama the latest</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She sent for Him, that Being who is noblest.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When Rama arrived and saw his father in a helpless state</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He was worried and enquired of Kaikeyi how the king's agony could abate</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Kaikeyi said, "Your father has decided to crown Bharatha instead of you;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To live in the forest for fourteen years is to be your due.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Do your duty and help your father keep his word of honour</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That you are a devoted son, show now by your demeanour."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama, without receding from his calm even for an instant</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Said, "O, dear father, over this decision, don't you lament!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Mother Kaikeyi, I shall do your bidding with alacrity</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I look upon you on par with Kaushalya: I see no disparity."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Thus said Rama, with a smile that dazzled like the full moon</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His face shone as if from a just-blossomed lotus it was hewn.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He prostrated at his father's feet and fell at Kaikeyi's too</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And left to tell His mother what He was duty-bound to do</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Kaushalya was shocked and dismayed by the king's action</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I shall go with you into exile, Rama," was her reaction</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But her exalted son gave her sage advice on wifely duty:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Stay and support your husband: make your station lofty."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama then went over to Sita to narrate the recent development</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita got ready to accompany Her Lord during His banishment</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama said: "O Sita, your delicate form cannot endure the hardship."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita replied: "I shall face worse pangs if I lose your companionship.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Oh dear husband, by recommending a varying rule</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">For Your mother and wife about wifely obligations, you will earn ridicule."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"My bag is all packed for a long sojourn in the wild:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I heard an astrologer predict the event, even as a child."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Janaki declared, "I shall go in front clearing every forest trail</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Your soft feet shall walk the smooth paths: you need not ail."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama had to agree and soon proceeded to Lakshmana's dwelling</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He beheld him standing there with emotions welling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I am ready to leave, Rama," said that gem among brothers,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Who, for Rama's sake, any peril and suffering weathers</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"If only you permit, I would rout the King and all his army</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And proclaim you King: you know it's no big task for me."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The soft-spoken Rama calmed Lakshmana, nay Adisesha, the serpent:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"There's a divinity that shapes our ends," said He to that foremost servant.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I want you to remain here and take care of Bharatha and our father</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And be a pillar of support to Kaushalya, our dear mother."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana laughed bitterly at Rama's suggestion</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I shall die from pangs of parting," he said with trepidation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Have you ever seen a fish survive out of water?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If you leave me behind, I shall not live a moment after."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana then took leave of Sumitra, his intelligent mother<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She said, "This is the sole purpose of your birth—about anything else, don't bother."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Support Rama at every step—do or die at His behest</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama is your father and Sita your mother from this moment, dearest!"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"A word of caution, my child," continued Sumitra, that knowing soul</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Never look at Rama's walk, lest you should forget service, which is your goal."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"You may look at Rama while He sits or stands and even when He is asleep</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But if you see His bewitching gait, your reason would be difficult to keep."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He walks in four distinct ways—angrily like a tiger and elegantly like an elephant</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Majestically like a lion and proudly like a bull: make a note this instant!"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With this blessing and sweet advice ringing in his ears</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The brave Lakshmana left to serve the duo for fourteen years.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama wore deer skin and matted His long hair,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana too donned a similar garb, leaving his person bare</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita, accustomed to dress in rich clothes and glittering ornaments</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Cast them all away and wore plain and simple garments</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The trio gifted away their belongings to Brahmins wise</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And prepared to make their departure in a trice.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Two kinds of Dharma exist Sadharana Dharma and Visesha Dharma<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A righteous man is sometimes confronted with ‘Dharmic’ dilemma</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He must consider and choose the one that serves the almighty better</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And must let go of the other as mere material clutter</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sadly, Dasaratha forgot his 'Visesha' dharma:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He should have dropped his promise for Rama</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Dasaratha failed to recognise his son as the highest truth</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And so reached inferior heaven instead of the feet of that divine youth</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, wise Urmila, Lakshmana's wife, followed her Visesha dharma</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She knew her husband's duty was to serve Rama</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Accompanying Lakshmana on exile would prove a distraction:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hence, the princess stayed behind without discussion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vasishta, the Royal guru, was appalled at the turn of events</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Seeing the princess off on exile was his most unpalatable of moments</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sumantra, Dasaratha's charioteer, was charged to convey Rama</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He found that wretched duty an unendurable trauma</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Helping the unruffled Rama, Lakshmana and Sita into the Royal vehicle,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The loyal driver set forth on that fateful mission, inevitable.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ayodhya's citizenry was profoundly shocked at the development so drastic<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Their frustration and anguish found vent in words caustic:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"The senile King has lost his reason—never mind!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We shall follow Rama wherever He goes; we shan't stay behind."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The men pursued their lofty prince, His dutiful wife, and their bodyguard:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And vowed to bring Rama back, even as they lamented hard.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita had never seen a forest, being delicately raised within royal grounds</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Is this our destination?" she asked as they came outside the palace bounds</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hearing this, people worried how She would face the jungle's dangers</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, to that princess sheltering under Rama's wings, hazards were mere strangers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Through Her action—trusting completely to Rama—Sita showed:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">People who surrender to the Supreme never feel cowed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sumantra drove the chariot fast at Rama's bidding</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But the people, including aged Brahmins, pursued them unrelenting</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On seeing this, Rama and His companions climbed down</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And began walking towards the forest area far away from their town<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Presently, the entire group prepared to rest at the Tamasa river</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The citizens continued to entreat Rama to return as their caregiver.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Hey Rama, we feel impelled to follow you</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We find happiness in Your company alone: You know our view</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Towards You, even animals, birds and plants show utter devotion</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">About what they are suffering now, we cannot begin to mention</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Either return with us to Ayodhya or desist from asking us to go back</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">For, Ayodhya devoid of You, is nothing but a desolate shack.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Talking in this vein to Rama, all those loving men</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Fell asleep—determined to wake at dawn and follow Rama then</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, the object of their love woke much in advance</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And for the welfare of His people, took a firm stance</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Instructing Sumantra to create wheel marks leading into their kingdom</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He left quietly with Sita and Lakshmana, that hero of martyrdom.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On waking the next morning and finding Rama gone,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That devoted crowd berated their sleep and turned forlorn</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Following the wheel marks, they turned towards their home</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Eventually losing the chariot tracks, they said, "We cannot forever roam.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama will keep His word to His father and will remain in exile</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Let us live in Ayodhya, as He intends us to, though it be vile."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Traveling swiftly, Rama's troupe reached the borders of Ayodhya</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They bid the sacred place farewell and reached the bank of the holy Ganga</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Guha, the Nishadha King of the region, of prowess incredible</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Received Rama with unconditional love, readily discernible</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Guha said: "All that is mine is yours Rama, to command</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Here I am, your servant, available always on demand."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama felt touched and pleased by Guha's reception</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He called to Sita and said, "Bless him with your look of kind affection."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Turning to Guha, He said, "This Mythili, my wife, is your friend from today.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And your brother Lakshmana is my brother too, I say.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Till now, King Dasaratha had four sons—we were four brothers</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With you, we have become five sons to our father and our dear mothers."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Thus did Rama show His generous nature and mingle with Guha</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">All beings were equal to that embodiment of 'Sousheelya.'</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama acknowledged Guha's hospitality, but stuck to the exile's prescribed code:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He refused rich foods and into inhabited precincts, he never strode.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The exiled prince agreed to stay with Guha in the forest for one night</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The hunter chief prepared beds of grass, ruminating sadly on Rama's plight.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">While Rama and Sita slept on their designated beds</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana circumambulated them with slow treads</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Guha, a tad suspicious about Lakshmana's intentions</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Went behind that devoted brother, watching his actions</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Guha's disciples, somewhat skeptical of their chief's motive</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Dogged the footsteps of that irascible native.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The entire night passed in this strange manner,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">While Rama and His consort rested peacefully in their corner</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">All the folks parading around and guarding them</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Resembled planets circumambulating the sun at their realm.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama's impeccable form and character evoked such a reaction</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It was ever so with everyone, there was no distinction.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The following morning, the hunter King pleaded with Rama to stay,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But that handsome prince said: "After fourteen years, I shall return this way."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Next, He told Guha "We must cross the river."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Guha replied: "All three of you, across these waters, I shall carefully deliver."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita prayed to the river Ganga to carry them safely</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I shall thank you upon our return," She promised, solemnly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama now implored Sumantra to return to the King</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Be a support to Father—to him, comfort you must bring."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The charioteer wanted to take messages from Sita and Lakshmana too</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The bewildered princess could not utter any words, not even a few.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana said: "Tell your King I no longer consider him my father.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama alone is everything to me: mother, father, master, and brother."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Following Sumantra's departure, Guha plied his boat with powerful strokes</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The pristine surroundings charmed the simple-minded royal folks</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After conveying the trio to the other side, Guha took his leave</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He consoled himself: "My despair, the memory of Rama's kindness would relieve."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama, Sita and Lakshmana, though tired, were hopeful</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Of finding a suitable place to stay and be cheerful.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Eventually, the illustrious three reached Sage Bharadwaja's hut:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That gratified elder welcomed and blessed Rama with eyes wet</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"How did my King have the heart to make you wear deer skin;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">More, how could he consent to see Sita in exile—Oh, what a sin?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Treat this poor dwelling as your own—it is my dearest desire</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With You and Sita next me, I shall attain the salvation I most aspire.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama gently declined the offer citing Ayodhya's proximity:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Frequent visitors would disturb this atmosphere of austerity.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Please suggest a place where my irreproachable wife would delight</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And where we can follow the dictates of exile without a blight."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharadwaja recommended Chitrakoota as the ideal location</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Where the three could remain isolated in peaceful contemplation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That mountain of Chitrakoota turned out to be a pleasurable spot<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Filled with beautiful trees, streams, hills, cascades and what-not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Edible fruits and roots too grew there in abundance—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Of physical and mental comfort, the place was a confluence<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama also spotted the hermitages of Valmiki and other ascetics<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And instantly chose to live among those eminent rustics<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana quickly built a lodging upon Rama's instruction</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They all entered their abode after offering due consecration</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The hut built with timber and leaves proved charming</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The three felt the agony of exile abate: cheer was in the offing</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The river Malyavati, which flowed nearby, increased their pleasure</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Watching the animals and birds in the region, made this time a treasure.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sumantra returned empty-handed to Ayodhya to everyone's disappointment</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He went straight to Dasaratha, there being no need for an appointment<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He found queens Kaushalya and Sumitra tending to the King, broken</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Controlling his tears, Sumantra tried voicing words of comfort, as a token.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">However, Dasaratha saw the charioteer's crestfallen face and understood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I knew He would not come back, my darling without falsehood."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Saying this, the loving father and unfortunate King fainted away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The queens could only watch, their minds under agony's sway</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When the King awoke, he narrated to Kaushalya an incident</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"It happened when I was a youth and has lain in my mind, dormant.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">My deep despondency has brought back that old memory</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On being parted from my son, I should die: I earned that curse, hoary."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Dasaratha continued, "One day I went to the forest on a hunt:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Felling animals without directly looking at them was my special stunt</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I heard a sound as of an animal drinking from a water hole</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I shot my arrow, unaware it would take a horrendous toll</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The next moment I heard an anguished yell</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And realised I had committed a blunder enough to land me in hell."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"I ran in the direction of the sound, only to see a young ascetic writhing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">My arrow had pierced him fatally and he lay in pain, dying</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Shocked, I ran to him and took his head upon my lap with fear</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He whispered, "My blind parents, thirsty, await me not far from here</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Give them water and confess your act—a thoughtless error</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This is the only way to escape from a curse filled with terror."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"So I hurried sadly in the direction he had indicated<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And went near his old parents, to get myself vindicated</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The mother and father, in a web of affliction, were caught:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They uttered a curse—it was with justice fraught!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Thus, on that fateful day, when I killed their son true</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Separation from my son and consequent aching death was the punishment I drew."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“O Rama, my child. You like to be ahead of me always:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I wanted to renounce my stately duties and royal days</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And take ‘Sanyas’ to live in the forest,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, You went there first, my life, my dearest!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">However, I do know how to get the better of you, my son</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I shall overtake thee to the heavens and weep there for my pardon.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">All this Dasaratha mournfully spoke and fell insensible</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To never wake and meet his death, terrible.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The two wives were struck with angst unendurable<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They had no sons near to console them in their trouble</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Alas! Despite begetting the Lord Supreme as his son</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Dasaratha's body lay embalmed: to perform his last rites, there was none!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Inconceivable is fate that baffled even Vasishta, the sage</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The options to handle the unfortunate situation, he began to gauge</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He sent the swiftest messengers to the kingdom of Kekaya<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To bring Bharatha and Shatrughna back post-haste to Ayodhya</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Refraining from sending any bad news, that dutiful elder</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hurried to make arrangements for the hereafter.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharatha and Shatrughna bid speedy farewells to their uncle</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They feared some bad event had occurred in their circle</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hurrying towards their hometown, the two brothers encountered</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Several bad omens that a catastrophe, portended</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Oh Shatrughna, my body trembles like a leaf in a storm</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I fear something has transpired that is completely against the norm."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The princes rushed forward with all possible speed</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And soon saw a neglected Ayodhya that made their hearts bleed</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharatha galloped into his mother's palace and stopped short</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Perceiving her widow's attire, he fell at her feet as if pinned by a dart</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Oh mother, have I lost my father, most affectionate?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">How is my brother bearing up with this calamity sent by fate?"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">At this, that stone-hearted Kaikeyi said: "Oh King, get up;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Your aged father has attained heaven; death is but a natural step."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On hearing this callous statement from his mother's lips</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That pure-souled Bharatha went cold unto his fingertips:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"How can you be so casual and why do you call me King?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Tell me all; I am anxious—must I bear any further ill-tiding?"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Your father sent Rama into exile for fourteen years</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita and Lakshmana followed Him: O, wipe your tears.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I got the King to give me two boons—you shall have the crown,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">While Rama remains in the forest; Oh, do remove that frown."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharatha at this wailed loudly and smote his head on the ground:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"How am I alive still? My life-force must be very sound!"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"You female monster! What made you think evil for my Rama?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">So, it was you who killed my father, unable to control your Kama?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">How did you believe I would fall in with your unjust wishes?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I shall now proceed to kill you, you serpent with tresses!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I declare, you are no longer my mother</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I fail to recognise you, you are a thorough stranger."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Now Shatrughna hurriedly restrained Bharatha with a caution:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"You will wound righteous Rama—control your passion."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharatha, collecting himself, ran towards Kaushalya's residence</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He wanted to fall at her feet and mourn their providence</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Upon sighting Bharatha, the wilting Kaushalya asked:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"With seeking further boons, have you been tasked?"</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Oh mother, your words have made my spirit perish</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Do you believe all this happened in accordance with my wish?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If that were true, let every kind of sin fall to my portion</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And let me go to netherworlds from where there is no redemption."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Saying this, the gentle-hearted Bharatha slid to the floor</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And Kaushalya, realising her mistake, was angry no more.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"Dear Bharatha, that I should think you capable of harm</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Shows I am not myself: I have lost my customary calm.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In my grief at losing my husband and son simultaneously</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I have wounded you to your heart, grievously</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Oh dear son, you are the greatest King Ayodhya has seen yet</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You shall make a fine ruler—l see why you are Rama's pet."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharatha said, "Mother, don’t address me as King—that I shall never be.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama shall be ruler and I, His eternal slave: I promise thee.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I shall seek Rama this instant and bring Him here</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He shall decorate the throne while I serve Him: don’t fear."</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On hearing these sweet words, Kaushalya became delighted</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She repented once more: “Your untainted mind I shouldn’t have slighted.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Now Bharatha went to meet their guru and well-wisher</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A relieved Vasishta said, “There isn’t a moment of leisure.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The king’s body awaits its religious last rites</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Shatrughna has to perform them: Dasaratha nullified your rights.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharatha laughed at the irony: “When I am no longer one of the heirs</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Why leave in my hands Ayodhya’s affairs?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, the dead’s last wishes had to be respected:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">So, Shatrughna cremated his father’s body as expected</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharatha told Vasishta: “I cannot accept the crown</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It’s a sin and will fail to bring me renown</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We must go and meet my brother, dear and just.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We will bring Him back and these anomalies, adjust.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vasishta was pleased and said: "Yours is a fair proposal<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, understand! Ayodhya's security is not at my disposal.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The kingdom needs a King without further delay</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Accept the crown before convincing Rama, this is no time to parlay.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To this Bharatha replied, “O revered one, why do you steal</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">My only treasure—the servitude towards Rama, which I feel?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The guru argued, “I know you are Rama’s property</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, one property sometimes guards another for security:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Does not a treasure-chest protect a valuable gemstone?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In the same spirit, why can’t you sit on Ayodhya’s throne?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Intelligent Bharatha rejected the simile saying, “Do ponder—it is the owner</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Who puts one property in charge of another.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Rama’s orders alone, I always await</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That is the fundamental mark of my trait</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I shall depart now in search of Rama, the avatar of truth</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Any other action, I reject as unworthy and uncouth.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Upon hearing Bharatha’s resolute decision</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The citizens shouted approval and joined his mission.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sumantra led Bharatha, melancholic and pensive</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">While the others followed optimistic, yet restive</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Soon the party reached the banks of Ganga’s holy waters</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Where Guha had met Rama and secured his release from material fetters</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">From far away, Rama’s friend spotted the large army</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Suspecting Bharatha of wrong aims, he became prey to emotions stormy</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Get ready, my followers: here is battle at our doors</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Anyone who thinks of harming Rama must first subdue our force</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama has honoured me by declaring me His friend</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If I hesitate to put down my life for Him, I shall be a fiend.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Let Bharatha bring an army that resembles a sea</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He cannot intimidate us: that, he will soon see.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Meanwhile Bharatha, having reached the river</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Silently stood by, his limbs and body in a quaver</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sumantra had the sensitive task of making the introductions</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He could perceive Bharatha and Guha’s passionate demonstrations:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">While Bharatha was in a state of insensibility</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Guha was wrathful and bubbling with volatility</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, as Guha came closer and clearly saw Bharatha’s person</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He wondered: “Resembling Rama so closely, can he think of treason?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This prince, bathed in tears, can never have thoughts nasty</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In suspecting him, I have been unintelligent and hasty.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sumantra now began to introduce Bharatha to the hunter chief:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“O Guha, behold Rama’s younger brother Bharatha, who stands swathed in grief.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Next, the faithful charioteer turned to Bharatha and said</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Here stands Guha, Rama’s friend, and the hunter community’s head.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Upon which, Bharatha greeted Guha with folded hands and asked:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Please tell me how Rama spent His time here and how in His love, you basked.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Rama spent a night here,” said Guha, “and upon us, benevolently He gazed</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lakshmana served Him incessantly and throughout, remained unfazed.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharatha expressed pleasure at Lakshmana’s love and care</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He eagerly asked, “In this rough forest, how did Rama and the others fare?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Guha then showed the corner where Rama and Sita had slept</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“O cruel Kaikeyi, look at what you did!” Bharatha bitterly wept</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And in uncontrollable emotion, he collapsed at Guha’s feet</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“How did dainty Rama sleep on this coarse grass—indeed it’s a rare feat!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Later, Guha helped Bharatha and his retinue cross the holy waters</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They all came upon Bharadwaja’s ashram where anxiety scatters</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“O Bharatha, do you want to harm Rama?” asked the sage bluntly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The unjust words froze that loyal brother—he gaped silently</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Even the omniscient sage suspects my intent,” he sobbed</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Of all my dignity and character, today, I stand robbed.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharadwaja immediately amended his words and said in a soothing voice:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“I wanted to show the world your greatness—don’t lose your poise.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Mollified, Bharatha told the sage what he had in mind</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On learning which, remorseful Bharadwaja, with tears became blind.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He said: “You stand alone, my dear child of destiny</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Only the thoughtless would put your love for Rama under scrutiny.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The sage then pointed out the directions to reach Chitrakoota</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That now ensconced Rama, Lakshmana and Sita.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Eager to reach his brother, Bharatha set the course swiftly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And with every step that took him closer, he became tearful repeatedly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Lakshmana, keeping a lookout for danger</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Spotted Kosala’s flags and a huge army approaching from yonder</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Darting into the hut he had built, Lakshmana dressed himself for war</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Astonished, Rama asked: “Have you sighted any peril afar?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“I see Bharatha accompanied by a large army<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He moves in our direction—his wicked intent is clear to me.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Here I am, an army unto myself, to screen you</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Let any number approach—they shall get their due.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With a pacific smile, Rama said: “You are making a mistake.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Don’t you understand Bharatha is here for my sake?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If, as you say, he has come resolved to fight me,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That thought alone is my death—this, I tell thee.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I know my brother like the back of my hand</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Put away the weapons; come next me and calmly stand.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharatha, seeing Rama from afar, stumbled forward in a rush</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As he dropped down at Rama’s feet, the entire place fell into a hush</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharatha’s supreme devotion permeated the surrounding</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Many minutes passed before anyone there could begin talking</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama said to Lakshmana with a meaning glance:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Observe My brother Bharatha and his unswerving stance.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“If you are interested in ruling our kingdom, I shall make the arrangement:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharatha will gladly stay with me—he only awaits my statement.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama never brooked insult to His devotees from any quarter</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hence, from being stern with Lakshmana, He did not falter<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharatha now imparted the news of their father’s death</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And Rama congealed into a statue, devoid of life’s breath</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Struck with terrible grief, Rama began wailing presently</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Your father’s gone; your in-law is no more” he cried loudly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Even in that moment of deep anguish, Rama would not accept</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His father had perished: He saw Lakshmana in Dasaratha’s place in every respect:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When someone assents to hold Rama as his or her all-in-all</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama made that soul His everything, once and for all.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After completing his father’s last rites, Rama enquired about Bharatha’s rule</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Are you being fair and compassionate, as we learnt in Vasishta’s school?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Are your decrees in accordance with what ‘Dharmic’ principles bid?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Are your actions in alignment with what our ancestors did?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To this Bharatha replied, “All your earlier questions are irrelevant</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Only the last question is valid: towards tradition, I am ever reverent.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“You and King Dasaratha changed the custom of kingship</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I shall set it right—you alone being fit for that worship</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You know I am Your servant and nothing more</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I haven’t become King—that would’ve wrecked my very core</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Please accept the kingdom and its responsibilities</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Return with us and honour our sensibilities.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama attempted to argue Bharatha out of his decision</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But failed to sway him from his conviction</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And though everyone pleaded, Rama too remained adamant</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“I must keep my promise and ensure truth’s establishment.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, Rama landed on a compromise arrangement</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Take my sandals; they shall rule on my behalf, as my replacement.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A person pawns a valuable artefact:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He gets a fraction of its worth for his act</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Similarly, Rama pledged with Bharatha His priceless footwear</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And extricated Himself from Ayodhya, as it were</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Thus, more than Rama, His ‘Paduka’ are valuable:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In sheltering His devotees, They are more capable.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama's 'Paduka' or sandals were originally very proud</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They felt: “Of exquisite qualities, our owner possesses a whole crowd.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When they saw Bharatha, begging Rama to return, with a devout heart<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They wondered, "This noble soul's wishes, would Rama dare thwart? <br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama has two paths opening out in front of him<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Either keeping His promise or relenting to Bharatha's appeals—choices grim.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Is Rama going to follow 'Sadharana dharma' and obey His father?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Or choose His 'Visesha dharma' and go back to His brother?"<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When Rama chose 'Sadharana dharma' His sandals decided: <br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">"No longer shall we stay here; our pride has subsided<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama should have fulfilled His devotee's pleas<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Even if it meant His own honour not remaining in one piece."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Thus, the 'Rama Mani Paduka' took Bharatha away and adorned his head<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And ruled justly over Kosala in Rama's stead<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When Bharatha left Rama's presence, he had a smile on his face<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, alighting at Ayodhya, of gloom alone he showed trace.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On the one hand, he was happy: he had discarded kingship<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On the other, he was sad: having temporarily lost Rama's companionship.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharatha installed the 'Paduka' on Ayodhya's royal throne<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Wearing ascetic garb and undertaking austerities, he shone<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He had pledged to Rama: "For fourteen years, I shall count each day and not tire<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But, if I don't see you on the morning after, I shall jump into fire."<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Staying at Nandigrama, on Ayodhya's border<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bharatha ruled well and in Rama’s kingdom, kept order.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A while after Bharatha left, Rama noticed anxiety among the sages<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Who lived in the vicinity of His lodging in various hermitages<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Upon enquiry, that merciful annihilator of demons discovered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That many ascetics had been attacked and murdered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Also that the demons, enraged by Rama’s presence<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Had been harassing the sages and wreaking their vengeance<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When the savants requested leave to quit that place, Rama agreed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">He too chose to leave Chitrakoota, as those wise people had decreed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On the way, Rama visited Sage Atri and offered His salutations<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Well content, that venerable personality bestowed his benedictions<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The elder then asked Sita to meet his aged wife, Anasuya<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Who was so exalted that none could envy her, that is, feel ‘asuya’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">That astute lady instructed Sita on wifely obligations and conduct<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And explained how the wrongs of a husband a wife must endeavour to correct<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She then said in passing: “But, since Rama’s divine attributes always dance<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To display ‘pathi vratha dharma’ you won’t really get a chance!”<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">At this Sita, stung, said: “Two types of love and respect exist<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">‘Guna Krita Dasyam’ and ‘Swaroopa Krita Dasyam’, as the wise insist.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“When people love others for their attributes, they demonstrate the former<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When someone loves another for their sake alone, they showcase the latter.<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">My devotion for Rama emanates from our relationship and stands for His person</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hence, whatever He does, I shall love Him the same: this I must mention.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Anasuya, well satisfied with this reply, asked Sita to describe her nuptials<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Please tell me all about how you wed Rama, who surpasses celestials.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sita began to narrate Rama’s entry into Mithila, with Lakshmana in tow<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And His incredible and effortless breaking of the ‘swayamvara’ bow<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She then described the various highlights of the wedding ceremony<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And told of the celebrations, gifts, and donations that were many<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Anasuya, thrilled with Sita’s meticulous explanations, gifted her many a jewel<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She then fondly declared: “Wherever you live, harmony shall dwell.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama, Sita and Lakshmana soon took leave of those aged ones<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And walked deeper into the forest to locate a new abode, per their directions<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rama in the front, followed by Sita, and Lakshmana<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Gave a life-like impersonation of ‘Aum’, the ‘Pranava’: <br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Paramatma is at the fore; the Jivatma takes the rear<br>
